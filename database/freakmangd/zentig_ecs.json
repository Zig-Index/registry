  "readme": "# zentig_ecs\nA Zig ECS library. \n\nZentig is designed for scalability and ease of use, while staying out of your way.\nIt's heavily inspired by everything that makes [bevy_ecs](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy)\nso great and [Unity](https://unity.com/) so approachable.\n\n##### WARNING:\nIt is not recommended to use zentig for anything major in its current state.\nWhile it is functional and I use it frequently, it is far from battle tested.\n\nThat being said, if you encounter any problems please feel free to open an issue!\n\n## Installation\nFetching for zig master:\n```\nzig fetch --save git+https://github.com/freakmangd/zentig_ecs\n```\n\nFetching for a specific zig version (for example, 0.15.1):\n```\nzig fetch --save https://github.com/freakmangd/zentig_ecs/archive/refs/tags/0.15.1.tar.gz\n```\n\nIn both cases, place this in your `build.zig`:\n```zig\nconst zentig = b.dependency(\"zentig_ecs\", .{});\nexe.root_module.addImport(\"ztg\", zentig.module(\"zentig\"));\n```\n\nAnd import it in your project:\n```zig\nconst ztg = @import(\"ztg\");\n```\n\n## Overview\nAn entity is just a `usize`:\n```zig\npub const Entity = usize;\n```\n\nA basic component:\n```zig\npub const Player = struct {\n  name: []const u8,\n};\n```\n\nA basic system:\n```zig\npub fn playerSpeak(q: ztg.Query(.{Player})) !void {\n  for (q.items(Player)) |plr| {\n    std.debug.print(\"My name is {s}\\n\", .{plr.name});\n  }\n}\n```\n\nRegistering systems/components into a world:\n```zig\nconst MyWorld = blk: {\n  var wb = ztg.WorldBuilder.init(&.{});\n  wb.addComponents(&.{Player});\n  wb.addSystemsToStage(.update, playerSpeak);\n  break :blk wb.Build();\n};\n```\n\nCalling systems is easily integratable into your game framework:\n```zig\ntest \"running systems\" {\n  var world = MyWorld.init(testing.allocator);\n  defer world.deinit();\n\n  try world.runStage(.load);\n  try world.runUpdateStages();\n  try world.runStage(.draw);\n  \n  // Support for user defined stages\n  try world.runStageList(&.{ .post_process, .pre_reset, .post_mortem });\n}\n```\n\n## Scalability\nThe `.include()` function in `WorldBuilder` makes it easy to compartmentalize your game systems.\nAs well as integrate third party libraries with only one extra line!\n\n`main.zig`:\n```zig\n// .include() looks for a `pub fn include(comptime *WorldBuilder) (!)void` def \n// in each struct. If the function errors it's a compile error,\n// but the signature can return either `!void` or `void`\nwb.include(&.{\n  ztg.base,\n  @import(\"player.zig\"),\n  @import(\"my_library\"),\n});\n```\n\n`player.zig`:\n```zig\npub fn include(comptime wb: *ztg.WorldBuilder) void {\n  wb.addComponents(.{ Player, PlayerGun, PlayerHUD });\n  wb.addSystemsToStage(.update, .{ update_player, update_gun, update_hud });\n}\n```\n\n`my_library/init.zig`:\n```zig\npub fn include(comptime wb: *ztg.WorldBuilder) void {\n  wb.include(&.{\n      // Namespaces can be included more than once to \"ensure\" \n      // they are included if you depend on them\n      ztg.base, \n      //...\n  });\n}\n```\n\n## Getting Started\nSee this short tutorial on creating systems and components [here](https://github.com/freakmangd/zentig_ecs/tree/main/docs/hello_world.md)\n\n## Full Examples\nSee full examples in the [examples folder](https://github.com/freakmangd/zentig_ecs/tree/main/examples)\n\n## Framework Support\nzentig is framework agnostic, it doesn't include any drawing capabilities. For that you need something like Raylib, I've created a library that\nwraps common Raylib components and provides systems that act on those components [here](https://github.com/freakmangd/zentig_raylib).\n\nThat page provides installation instructions and usage examples.\n",
