  "readme": "# struct to stream | stream to struct\n\nA Zig binary serialization format and library.\n\n![Project logo](design/logo.png)\n\n## Features\n\n- Convert (nearly) any Zig runtime datatype to binary data and back.\n- Computes a stream signature that prevents deserialization of invalid data.\n- No support for graph like structures. Everything is considered to be tree data.\n\n**Unsupported types**:\n\n- All `comptime` only types\n- Unbound pointers (c pointers, pointer to many)\n- `volatile` pointers\n- Untagged or `external` unions\n- Opaque types\n- Function pointers\n- Frames\n\n## API\n\nThe library itself provides only some APIs, as most of the serialization process is not configurable.\n\n```zig\n/// Serializes the given `value: T` into the `stream`.\n/// - `stream` is a instance of `std.Io.Writer`\n/// - `T` is the type to serialize\n/// - `value` is the instance to serialize.\nfn serialize(stream: *std.Io.Writer, comptime T: type, value: T) std.Io.Writer.Error!void;\n\n/// Deserializes a value of type `T` from the `stream`.\n/// - `stream` is a instance of `std.Io.Reader`\n/// - `T` is the type to deserialize\nfn deserialize(stream: *std.Io.Reader, comptime T: type) (std.Io.Reader.Error || error{UnexpectedData,EndOfStream})!T;\n\n/// Deserializes a value of type `T` from the `stream`.\n/// - `stream` is a instance of `std.Io.Reader`\n/// - `T` is the type to deserialize\n/// - `allocator` is an allocator require to allocate slices and pointers.\n/// Result must be freed by using `free()`.\nfn deserializeAlloc(stream: *std.Io.Reader, comptime T: type, allocator: std.mem.Allocator) (std.Io.Reader.Error || error{ UnexpectedData, OutOfMemory,EndOfStream })!T;\n\n/// Releases all memory allocated by `deserializeAlloc`.\n/// - `allocator` is the allocator passed to `deserializeAlloc`.\n/// - `T` is the type that was passed to `deserializeAlloc`.\n/// - `value` is the value that was returned by `deserializeAlloc`.\nfn free(allocator: std.mem.Allocator, comptime T: type, value: T) void;\n```\n\n## Usage and Development\n\n### Adding the library\n\nJust add the `s2s.zig` as a package to your Zig project. It has no external dependencies.\n\n### Running the test suite\n\n```sh-session\n[user@host s2s]$ zig test s2s.zig\nAll 3 tests passed.\n[user@host s2s]$\n```\n\n## Project Status\n\nMost of the serialization/deserialization is implemented for the _trivial_ case.\n\nPointers/slices with non-standard alignment aren't properly supported yet.\n",
