  "readme": "# ZGL – Zig OpenGL Bindings\n\nThis library provides a thin, type-safe binding for OpenGL.\n\n## Example\n\n```zig\n// Use classic OpenGL flavour\nvar vao = gl.createVertexArray();\ndefer gl.deleteVertexArray(vao);\n\n// Use object oriented flavour\nvar vertex_buffer = gl.Buffer.create();\ndefer vertex_buffer.delete();\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd zgl to your `build.zig.zon` with the following command:\n\n`zig fetch --save https://github.com/ziglibs/zgl/archive/[commit_hash].tar.gz`\n\nReplace [commit_hash] with the latest commit or tagged release.\n\nThen add the following to your `build.zig`:\n\n```zig\nconst zgl = b.dependency(\"zgl\", .{\n    .target = target,\n    .optimize = optimize,\n});\nexe.root_module.addImport(\"zgl\", zgl.module(\"zgl\"));\n```\n\nThen import it with `const gl = @import(\"zgl\");`, and build as normal with `zig build`.\n\n## Development Philosophy\n\nThis library is developed incrementally. That means that functions and other things will be included on-demand and not just for the sake of completeness.\n\nIf you think a function is missing, fork the library, implement the missing function similar to the other functions and make a pull request. Issues that request implementation of missing functions will be closed immediately.\n\n## Generated Bindings\n\nThis library includes OpenGL 4.5 bindings, generated by [zig-opengl](https://github.com/MasterQ32/zig-opengl). Bindings for a different version may be substituted by replacing [binding.zig](src/binding.zig).\n",
