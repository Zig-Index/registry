  "readme": "# hawwaz\n\nThis is a little Zig library that provides a function to calculate the\n[_abjad_ numeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad_numerals) value of a\nstring of Arabic-script text. A few options can be configured: Mashriqi vs.\nMaghribi letter order, whether to count an _alif madda_ as one or two *alif*s,\netc. The logic is based on implementations that I've written in other languages,\nincluding [TypeScript](https://github.com/theodore-s-beers/abjadcalc) and\n[Rust](https://github.com/theodore-s-beers/abjad-rs).\n\nI hope to add more documentation here later. For the time being, it may be\ninstructive to review the notes on my site\n[abjadcalc.com](https://www.abjadcalc.com/).\n\nTo build the library and run tests:\n\n```sh\nzig build test\n```\n",
