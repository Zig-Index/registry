Your objective is to move your red pawn from the top of the board to the bottom of the board\n - Player 2 starts at the bottom and is attempting to reach the top of the board\n - On each turn you can either move your pawn or add one fence piece to the board (you have 10 to start with)\n\n## Moving a pawn\n\n - Use the cursor keys to choose where to move to. Your pawn may only move one square on each turn and cannot move diagonally\n - The \"[ ]\" mark where your pawn will move and is coloured green for a valid move and red for invalid\n - Once you have selected a move, press enter to move the pawn\n\n## Adding a fence\n\n - Press tab to switch from pawn to fence mode\n - Use the cursor keys to choose where to add the fence\n - Fences must not cross other fences, or completely block either player from reaching their goal. An invalid fence position will be shown in red\n - To rotate the fence, press space\n - Once you have positioned the fence, press enter to place it\n\n# Command line options\n\nHelp\n\n    zig build run -- -h\n\nTo watch machine vs machine matches forever:\n\n    zig build run -- -1 machine -2 machine -f\n\nOn exit, a record of all moves is printed in both Glendenning format and base64. The base64 format can be reloaded with `zig build run -- -l jcNJujqxKRY2sA==`\n\n# Theory\n\nFor a comprehensive examination of playing Quoridor, see [Lisa Glendenning's Thesis](https://www.labri.fr/perso/renault/working/teaching/projets/files/glendenning_ugrad_thesis.pdf)\n\n",
