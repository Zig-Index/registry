Tested with Zig 0.15.2\n\n`zig build run`\n\nCursor keys to move, space to drop, `q` to quit.\n\n![](demo.gif)\n\n# Run as a service via ssh\n\n    ./run-as-service.sh\n\n    ssh zigtris@localhost -p 2022\n\n# Notes\n\nSome notes for anyone looking at the code:\n\n - `Display` is a thin wrapper on top of the `mibu` terminal library, it provides a double buffered one pixel per character interface where it only redraws changed pixels on the buffer flip\n - `Stage` is the game stage and provides a square pixel interface on top of `Display` (by printing two chars for each pixel)\n - `Player` holds the `Tetronimo` shapes and movement logic\n - `Debris` holds the list of fallen blocks for hitchecking and completed line detection\n\n# License\n\nMIT\n\n",
