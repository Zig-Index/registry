(ˌmɪsˈʃɒd). adj. badly shod*\n\n# About\n\nMiSSHod is a minimal, experimental SSH client and server implemented as a library.\n\nIt has been tested with both [OpenSSH](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable) and [Dropbear](https://github.com/mkj/dropbear).\n\n**MiSSHod is not secure, it should not be used in real world systems**\n\nIt aims to be:\n\n - Transport and I/O agnostic - TCP would be normal, but MiSShod can be run over any reliable stream protocol\n - Asynchronous - MiSShod never blocks execution for I/O, it enters a wait state and can be resumed when data arrives\n - Callback free - asynchronous message passing prevents the caller needing callbacks and context structs\n - Very lightweight, opening up the possibility of running on small embedded devices\n\n**Features**\n\n - Public key auth\n - Password auth\n - Supports exactly one of each of the required protocols\n    - hmac-sha2-256 (hmac)\n    - curve25519-sha256 (key exchange)\n    - ssh-ed25519 (key)\n    - aes256-ctr (cipher)\n\n# Building\n\nMiSSHod requires [Zig 0.14.0](https://ziglang.org/download/). \n\n## Client\n\nTo build `mssh`, a command line SSH client for Mac/Linux\n\n```bash\nzig build test\n```\n\n```bash\ncd mssh\nzig build\n./zig-out/bin/mssh\n./zig-out/bin/mssh <username@host> <port> [idfile]\n```\n\nTo run a test SSH server (dropbear) in docker\n\n```bash\ncd testserver\n./sshserver\n```\n\nLogin with password auth, (\"password\")\n\n```bash\n./zig-out/bin/mssh testuser@127.0.0.1 2022\n# Same as: ssh -p 2022 testuser@127.0.0.1\n```\n\nLogin with pubkey auth using a passwordless private key\n\n```bash\n./zig-out/bin/mssh testuser@127.0.0.1 2022 ../testserver/id_ed25519_passwordless\n# Same as: ssh -p 2022 testuser@127.0.0.1 -i ../testserver/id_ed25519_passwordless\n```\n\nLogin with pubkey auth using a password protected private key (\"secretpassword\")\n\n```bash\n./zig-out/bin/mssh testuser@127.0.0.1 2022 ../testserver/id_ed25519_passworded\n# Same as: ssh -p 2022 testuser@127.0.0.1 -i ../testserver/id_ed25519_passworded\n```\n\n## Server\n\n`msshd` is a toy ssh server. It handles one connection at a time and echoes back received data with \"You said X\".\n\nTo build `msshd`\n\n```bash\ncd msshd\nzig build\n./zig-out/bin/msshd\n./zig-out/bin/msshd <port> <hostkey>\n```\n\nTo run the server\n\n```bash\n./zig-out/bin/msshd 2022 ../testserver/id_ed25519_passwordless\nServer listening on port 2022\n```\n\nConnect using OpenSSH\n\n```bash\nssh -p 2022 foo@127.0.0.1\n```\n\nBy default the server will accept any public key offered. Typically, OpenSSH offers all available keys, so it will be able to login immediately. This can be changed in `msshd/src/main.zig`. Typically, a real server would check the user's `authorized_keys` file.\n\nConnect using `mssh` using pubkey auth (key password is \"secretpassword\")\n\n```bash\ncd mssh\nzig build run -- foo@127.0.0.1 2022 ../testserver/id_ed25519_passworded\n```\n\nConnect using `mssh` using password auth (any password matching username will be accepted, so \"foo\" here)\n\n```bash\ncd mssh\nzig build run -- foo@127.0.0.1 2022\n```\n\n\n# Tiny client example\n\nAs a proof of concept, the `tiny` example logs into the test server but contains no socket code. Instead, it uses stdout and stdin. To run it via `socat`:\n\n```bash\nzig build && socat TCP4:127.0.0.1:2022 EXEC:./zig-out/bin/tiny\n```\n\nTiny uses a weaker PRNG, a fixed buffer allocator and does no file I/O.\n\n# Security\n\n**MiSSHod is not secure, it should not be used in real world systems**\n\n - Very little testing has been done and not all code paths have been exercised\n - No efforts have been made to prevent timing attacks\n - Sensitive data is held in RAM for longer than is strictly necessary\n - MiSSHod relies on Zig's standard library for all crypto algorithms, which is still relatively young\n - Most importantly, I am not a cryptographer and I have no idea what I'm doing\n\n# Status\n\nMiSSHod was developed rapidly. The main aim was to get it working and learn something along the way. I don't know what's next, but hopefully you can learn something too by looking at a small SSH implementation.\n\nIt's entirely undocumented and there aren't enough tests. The IO systems are a bit arcane, as I've tried wherever possible to avoid using excess RAM.\n\n",
