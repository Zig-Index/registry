The compiled binary will be optimized for your specific platform, while pre-built binaries are built for the lowest common denominator.\n\nRequirements: [Zig](https://ziglang.org/download/) (master)\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/jedisct1/turbocrypt.git\ncd turbocrypt\nzig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast\n```\n\nThe compiled binary will be in `zig-out/bin/turbocrypt`. Move it elsewhere, add it to your PATH or use the full path.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Step 1: Generate an Encryption Key\n\nFirst, create a key file. This is a random 128-bit key that you'll use to encrypt and decrypt your files.\n\n```bash\nturbocrypt keygen secret.key\n```\n\nImportant: Keep this key file safe! Anyone with access to it can decrypt your files.\n\n### Step 2: Set Your Default Key\n\nStore the key in your configuration so you don't have to specify it every time:\n\n```bash\nturbocrypt config set-key secret.key\n```\n\nAfter this, you can encrypt and decrypt without specifying the key. The tool is now ready to use!\n\n### Step 3: Encrypt Files\n\nEncrypt a single file:\n\n```bash\nturbocrypt encrypt document.pdf document.pdf.enc\n```\n\nEncrypt an entire directory:\n\n```bash\nturbocrypt encrypt my-documents/ encrypted-documents/\n```\n\n### Step 4: Verify Encrypted Files\n\nCheck that your encrypted files are intact:\n\n```bash\nturbocrypt verify encrypted-documents/\n```\n\nThis confirms all files were encrypted successfully and haven't been corrupted or tampered with.\n\nFor a faster check that just verifies you have the correct key:\n\n```bash\nturbocrypt verify --quick encrypted-documents/\n```\n\n### Step 5: Decrypt Files\n\nDecrypt a file:\n\n```bash\nturbocrypt decrypt document.pdf.enc document.pdf\n```\n\nDecrypt the entire directory:\n\n```bash\nturbocrypt decrypt encrypted-documents/ my-documents/\n```\n\nThat's it!\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Password-Protected Keys\n\nIf you want to protect your key file, you can encrypt it with a password:\n\n```bash\n# Generate a password-protected key\nturbocrypt keygen --password protected.key\n# Enter your password when prompted\n\n# Use it (you'll be prompted for the password)\nturbocrypt encrypt --key protected.key --password source/ dest/\n```\n\n### Managing Key Passwords\n\nYou can add, change, or remove password protection on existing keys:\n\n```bash\n# Add password protection to a plain key\nturbocrypt change-password secret.key\n# Enter your new password when prompted\n\n# Change the password on a protected key\nturbocrypt change-password protected.key\n# Enter current password, then new password\n\n# Remove password protection from a key\nturbocrypt change-password --remove-password protected.key\n# Enter current password to confirm\n```\n\nThis is useful when you want to:\n- Add password protection to an existing plain key without regenerating it\n- Change a compromised or forgotten password while keeping the same encryption key\n- Remove password protection when moving a key to secure storage\n\n### Adding an Extra Layer of Protection with Contexts\n\nWhen you encrypt a directory, you can optionally specify a context string. This adds an additional secret that's required to decrypt your files - think of it as a second password that works alongside your encryption key.\n\nHere's why this matters: Even if someone gains access to your encryption key file and your password, they still won't be able to decrypt your files without knowing the context you used. The context acts as an extra safeguard that you keep in your head rather than written down.\n\n```bash\n# Encrypt with a context\nturbocrypt encrypt --key my-secret.key --context \"my-secret-phrase\" documents/ encrypted/\n\n# To decrypt, you MUST provide the exact same context\nturbocrypt decrypt --key my-secret.key --context \"my-secret-phrase\" encrypted/ documents/\n\n# Wrong context? Decryption will fail, even with the correct key\nturbocrypt decrypt --key my-secret.key --context \"wrong-phrase\" encrypted/ documents/\n# Error: Wrong decryption key, wrong context, or corrupted file header\n```\n\nEach context creates completely different encrypted files, even when using the same key. Files encrypted with context \"project-a\" cannot be decrypted with context \"project-b\", or without any context at all.\n\n### Encrypting in Place\n\nSometimes you want to encrypt files directly without creating copies:\n\n```bash\nturbocrypt encrypt --key my-secret.key --in-place my-documents/\n```\n\nWarning: This overwrites the original files. Make sure you have backups first!\n\n### Hiding Filenames\n\nIf you want to conceal not just the contents but also the names of your files:\n\n```bash\n# Encrypt with encrypted filenames\nturbocrypt encrypt --key my-secret.key --encrypted-filenames source/ dest/\n\n# Decrypt - you MUST use --encrypted-filenames to decrypt\nturbocrypt decrypt --key my-secret.key --encrypted-filenames dest/ restored/\n```\n\nThis encrypts each filename component, making it impossible to tell what files are in the encrypted directory without the key. Note: You must use `--encrypted-filenames` for both encryption AND decryption.\n\n### Skipping Certain Files\n\nUse exclude patterns to skip files you don't want to encrypt:\n\n```bash\n# Skip log files and the .git directory\nturbocrypt encrypt --key my-secret.key \\\n  --exclude \"*.log\" \\\n  --exclude \".git/\" \\\n  my-project/ encrypted-project/\n```\n\nCommon exclude patterns:\n- `*.log` - skip all .log files\n- `*.tmp` - skip temporary files\n- `.git/` - skip git repository data\n- `node_modules/` - skip Node.js dependencies\n- `__pycache__/` - skip Python cache files\n\n### Previewing Operations with Dry Run\n\nBefore encrypting or decrypting files, you can preview what will happen without actually processing them:\n\n```bash\n# See what files would be encrypted\nturbocrypt encrypt --dry-run --key my-secret.key documents/ encrypted/\n\n# Test exclude patterns before committing\nturbocrypt encrypt --dry-run --key my-secret.key \\\n  --exclude \"*.log\" \\\n  --exclude \"node_modules/\" \\\n  large-project/ encrypted-project/\n\n# Preview decryption\nturbocrypt decrypt --dry-run --key my-secret.key encrypted/ restored/\n```\n\nThis is particularly useful for:\n- Testing exclude patterns before processing large directories\n- Verifying source and destination paths are correct\n- Estimating how many files will be processed\n- Checking operations before committing to them\n\nThe `--dry-run` flag works with all operations (encrypt, decrypt, verify) and shows accurate file counts and sizes without modifying any files.\n\n### Verifying File Integrity\n\nCheck if encrypted files are intact without decrypting them:\n\n```bash\n# Verify a single file\nturbocrypt verify --key my-secret.key encrypted-file.enc\n\n# Verify an entire directory\nturbocrypt verify --key my-secret.key encrypted-documents/\n\n# Quick verification (only checks if you have the correct key)\nturbocrypt verify --quick --key my-secret.key encrypted-documents/\n```\n\nThis is useful for checking backups or verifying files after transferring them.\n\nQuick vs Full Verification:\n- `--quick`: Only verifies the header MAC (checks if you have the correct key). Much faster but doesn't verify data integrity.\n- Full verification (default): Checks both the header MAC and content, ensuring both key correctness and data integrity.\n\n### Listing Encrypted Directory Contents\n\nYou can list the contents of an encrypted directory without fully decrypting the files:\n\n```bash\n# List encrypted directory (shows encrypted filenames as-is)\nturbocrypt list encrypted-documents/\n\n# List with decrypted filenames (requires the correct key)\nturbocrypt list --key my-secret.key --encrypted-filenames encrypted-documents/\n```\n\nThe list command displays:\n- File paths (decrypted if `--encrypted-filenames` is used)\n- File sizes (encrypted size, which includes 48-byte overhead per file)\n- Total file count and combined size\n\nThis is useful for:\n- Browsing encrypted backups without extracting them\n- Verifying what files are in an encrypted archive\n- Finding specific files before decrypting the entire directory\n- Quick inventory of encrypted data\n\nExample output:\n```\nListing contents: encrypted-documents/\n\n  report.pdf (2500 bytes)\n  memo.doc (1248 bytes)\n  photos/sunset.jpg (5347 bytes)\n  photos/beach.jpg (4896 bytes)\n\nTotal: 4 files, 13.4 KB\n```\n\n### Setting Up Defaults\n\nIf you use the same key and settings frequently, save them:\n\n```bash\n# Set your default key (stores it in config)\nturbocrypt config set-key my-secret.key\n\n# Set default thread count\nturbocrypt config set-threads 8\n\n# Add permanent exclude patterns\nturbocrypt config add-exclude \"*.log\"\nturbocrypt config add-exclude \".git/\"\n\n# View your configuration\nturbocrypt config show\n```\n\nNow you can run commands without repeating options:\n\n```bash\n# Uses the key and excludes from your config\nturbocrypt encrypt source/ dest/\n```\n\n## All Commands\n\n### Key Management\n\n```bash\n# Generate a new key\nturbocrypt keygen output.key\n\n# Generate a password-protected key\nturbocrypt keygen --password output.key\n\n# Add password protection to existing key\nturbocrypt change-password my.key\n\n# Change password on protected key\nturbocrypt change-password protected.key\n\n# Remove password protection\nturbocrypt change-password --remove-password protected.key\n\n# Set default key in config\nturbocrypt config set-key my.key\n```\n\n### Encryption\n\n```bash\n# Basic encryption\nturbocrypt encrypt --key KEY source dest\n\n# With password-protected key\nturbocrypt encrypt --key KEY --password source dest\n\n# Encrypt in place (overwrites source)\nturbocrypt encrypt --key KEY --in-place source/\n\n# Encrypt filenames too\nturbocrypt encrypt --key KEY --encrypted-filenames source/ dest/\n\n# Exclude certain files\nturbocrypt encrypt --key KEY --exclude \"*.log\" --exclude \".git/\" source/ dest/\n\n# Use context for key derivation\nturbocrypt encrypt --key KEY --context \"project-x\" source/ dest/\n\n# Add .enc suffix automatically\nturbocrypt encrypt --key KEY --enc-suffix source/ dest/\n\n# Custom thread count\nturbocrypt encrypt --key KEY --threads 16 source/ dest/\n\n# Preview without actually encrypting\nturbocrypt encrypt --key KEY --dry-run source/ dest/\n```\n\n### Decryption\n\n```bash\n# Basic decryption\nturbocrypt decrypt --key KEY source dest\n\n# Decrypt in place\nturbocrypt decrypt --key KEY --in-place encrypted/\n\n# Decrypt encrypted filenames (must use --encrypted-filenames if used during encryption)\nturbocrypt decrypt --key KEY --encrypted-filenames encrypted/ decrypted/\n\n# Decrypt with context (must match encryption context)\nturbocrypt decrypt --key KEY --context \"project-x\" encrypted/ decrypted/\n\n# Remove .enc suffix automatically\nturbocrypt decrypt --key KEY --enc-suffix encrypted/ decrypted/\n\n# Preview without actually decrypting\nturbocrypt decrypt --key KEY --dry-run encrypted/ decrypted/\n```\n\n### Verification\n\n```bash\n# Verify file integrity (full verification)\nturbocrypt verify --key KEY encrypted-file.enc\n\n# Verify directory (full verification)\nturbocrypt verify --key KEY encrypted-directory/\n\n# Quick verification (only checks key correctness, not data integrity)\nturbocrypt verify --quick --key KEY encrypted-directory/\n\n# Quick verification with context\nturbocrypt verify --quick --key KEY --context \"project-x\" encrypted/\n\n# Preview verification without actually verifying\nturbocrypt verify --key KEY --dry-run encrypted/\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\n```bash\n# View current settings\nturbocrypt config show\n\n# Set default key\nturbocrypt config set-key path/to/key\n\n# Set thread count\nturbocrypt config set-threads 8\n\n# Set buffer size (in bytes)\nturbocrypt config set-buffer-size 8388608\n\n# Manage exclude patterns\nturbocrypt config add-exclude \"*.tmp\"\nturbocrypt config remove-exclude \"*.tmp\"\n\n# Set symlink behavior\nturbocrypt config set-ignore-symlinks true\n\n# Set filename encryption default\nturbocrypt config set-encrypted-filenames true\n```\n\n### Performance Testing\n\n```bash\n# Run benchmarks\nturbocrypt bench\n```\n\n## Command-Line Options\n\nOptions available for most commands:\n\n- `--key <path>` - Path to key file (required unless set in config)\n- `--password` - Prompt for password (for password-protected keys)\n- `--context <string>` - Context string for key derivation (creates independent key namespace)\n- `--threads <n>` - Number of parallel threads (default: CPU count capped at 16, max 64)\n- `--in-place` - Overwrite source files instead of creating new ones\n- `--encrypted-filenames` - Encrypt/decrypt filenames (required for both encryption and decryption, cannot be used with --in-place)\n- `--enc-suffix` - Add/remove .enc suffix automatically\n- `--exclude <pattern>` - Skip files matching pattern (can use multiple times)\n- `--ignore-symlinks` - Skip symbolic links\n- `--quick` - (verify only) Only check header MAC, skip full verification - faster but doesn't verify data integrity\n- `--dry-run` - Show what would be processed without actually encrypting/decrypting - useful for testing exclude patterns and verifying operations\n- `--force` - Overwrite existing files without asking\n- `--buffer-size <bytes>` - Set I/O buffer size (default: 4MB)\n\n## File Portability\n\nEncrypted files can be freely moved between directories and renamed. The encryption intentionally does not depend on the file's path, filename, or parent directories. This means you can reorganize and rename your encrypted files however you like without needing to re-encrypt them.\n\n### Filename Encryption\n\nWhen using `--encrypted-filenames`:\n\n- Each path component (directory or filename) is encrypted separately\n- Encoded with base91 to ensure filesystem compatibility\n- Preserves directory structure (you still see folders, just with encrypted names)\n- Must be used for both encryption and decryption operations\n\n## Configuration File\n\nTurboCrypt stores your settings in a JSON configuration file:\n\n- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/turbocrypt/config.json`\n- Linux: `~/.local/share/turbocrypt/config.json`\n- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\turbocrypt\\config.json`\n\nThe config file is created with restricted permissions (owner read/write only) to protect your key if you choose to store it there.\n\n### Priority Order\n\nSettings are applied in this order (highest priority first):\n\n1. Command-line flags (e.g., `--key`, `--threads`)\n2. Environment variables (`TURBOCRYPT_KEY_FILE`)\n3. Configuration file settings\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### Key Management\n\n- Generate strong keys: Always use `turbocrypt keygen` - don't create keys manually\n- Keep backups: Store a copy of your key in a safe, separate location\n- Use password protection: For keys stored on your computer, consider using `turbocrypt keygen --password` or adding protection later with `turbocrypt change-password`\n- Change passwords when needed: If you suspect your password may be compromised, use `turbocrypt change-password` to update it without regenerating the key\n- Never share keys: Each person should have their own key, or use password-protected keys with different passwords for additional security\n\n### Safe Workflows\n\n- Preview first: Use `--dry-run` to see what will be processed before running the actual operation\n- Test first: Try encrypting/decrypting a small test directory before processing important data\n- Test exclude patterns: Use `--dry-run` with `--exclude` to verify your patterns work as expected\n- Verify after transfer: Use `turbocrypt verify` to check files after copying or uploading them\n- Keep originals: Don't delete unencrypted files until you've verified the encrypted versions\n- Exclude unnecessary files: Use `--exclude` to skip cache, logs, and other regenerable files\n\n### Performance Tips\n\n- Adjust threads for directories: Use `--threads` based on your CPU core count and disk features\n- Larger buffers for huge files: Try `--buffer-size 16777216` (16MB) for very large files\n- Exclude unnecessary files: Using exclude patterns is faster than encrypting files and deleting them later\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### \"Wrong decryption key, wrong context, or corrupted file header\"\n\nThis error means either:\n- You're using the wrong key file\n- You're using the wrong context (or missing a required context)\n- The file wasn't encrypted with TurboCrypt\n- The file header is corrupted\n\nDouble-check you're using the same key and context that were used to encrypt the file.\n\n### \"Authentication failed\" during decryption\n\nThe file has been modified or corrupted after encryption. TurboCrypt detected tampering and refused to decrypt. This is a security feature - the file may have been altered maliciously or damaged during storage/transfer.\n\n### \"Access denied\" errors with large files\n\nOn some systems, memory-mapped I/O (used for files >1MB) requires specific permissions. Try running with sudo/administrator privileges, or check that your user has read/write access to both source and destination directories.\n\n### Performance is slow\n\n- Check if you're using too many threads (`--threads 4` is often faster than 32 for small files)\n- Ensure your source/destination are on fast storage (SSD vs HDD makes a big difference)\n- For many small files, threading overhead can reduce performance - try using `--threads 2`\n\n### Out of memory errors\n\nReduce the buffer size: `--buffer-size 1048576` (1MB instead of default 4MB)\n\n## Environment Variables\n\n- `TURBOCRYPT_KEY_FILE`: Path to your key file (overridden by `--key` flag)\n\nExample:\n\n```bash\nexport TURBOCRYPT_KEY_FILE=~/.ssh/turbocrypt.key\nturbocrypt encrypt source/ dest/  # Uses key from environment\n```\n",
