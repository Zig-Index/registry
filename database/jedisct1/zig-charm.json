  "readme": "# charm\n\nA tiny, self-contained cryptography library, implementing authenticated encryption and keyed hashing.\n\nCharm was especially designed for memory-constrained devices, but can also be used to add encryption support to WebAssembly modules with minimal overhead.\n\nAny number of hashing and authenticated encryption operations can be freely chained using a single rolling state.\nIn this mode, each authentication tag authenticates the whole transcript since the beginning of the session.\n\nThe [original implementation](https://github.com/jedisct1/charm) was written in C and is used by the [dsvpn](https://github.com/jedisct1/dsvpn) VPN software.\n\nThis is a port to the [Zig](https://ziglang.org) language. It is fully compatible with the C version.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Setting up a session\n\nCharm requires a 256-bit key, and, if the key is reused for different sessions, a unique session identifier (`nonce`):\n\n```zig\nvar key: [Charm.key_length]u8 = undefined;\nstd.crypto.random.bytes(&key);\n\nvar charm = Charm.new(key, null);\n```\n\n### Hashing\n\n```zig\nconst h = charm.hash(\"data\");\n```\n\n### Authenticated encryption\n\n#### Encryption\n\n```zig\nconst tag = charm.encrypt(msg[0..]);\n```\n\nEncrypts `msg` in-place and returns a 128-bit authentication tag.\n\n#### Decryption\n\nStarting from the same state as the one used for encryption:\n\n```zig\ntry charm.decrypt(msg[0..], tag);\n```\n\nReturns `error.AuthenticationFailed` if the authentication tag is invalid for the given message and the previous transcript.\n\n## Security guarantees\n\n128-bit security, no practical limits on the size and length of messages.\n\n## Other implementations:\n\n- [charm](https://github.com/jedisct1/charm) original implementation in C.\n- [charm.js](https://github.com/jedisct1/charm.js) a JavaScript (TypeScript) implementation.\n- [go-charm](https://github.com/x13a/go-charm) a Go implementation.\n",
