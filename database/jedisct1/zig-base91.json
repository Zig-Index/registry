  "readme": "# Base91 for Zig\n\nAn implementation of the Base91 encoding scheme written in Zig.\n\nIt enables you to convert binary data to a Base91-encoded string and vice versa.\n\n## Overview\n\n- **Space Efficiency:** Base91 produces shorter encoded strings compared to Base64, which can be advantageous when minimizing data size is a priority.\n- **Performance Trade-Off:** Although Base91 is more space-efficient, its encoding/decoding operations are generally slower than those of Base64. This trade-off should be considered based on your application’s requirements.\n\n## Considerations\n\n- **When to Use:** Opt for Base91 when reducing the size of encoded data is critical, such as in bandwidth-constrained environments or when storing large volumes of encoded data.\n- **When to Avoid:** If your application is performance-sensitive and the encoding/decoding speed is paramount, Base64 might be a more suitable alternative.\n",
