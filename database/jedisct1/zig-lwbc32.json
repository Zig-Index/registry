  "readme": "# LWBC32: Lightweight 32-bit Block Cipher Library\n\nA Zig implementation of three lightweight block ciphers: SPECK32/64, SIMON32/64, and SIMECK32/64. These ciphers are designed for use in resource-constrained environments and offer high performance in software implementations.\n\n## Ciphers Overview\n\nAll three ciphers in this library operate on 32-bit blocks (split into two 16-bit words) with 64-bit keys:\n\n| Cipher      | Block Size | Key Size | Rounds | Structure                     |\n| ----------- | ---------- | -------- | ------ | ----------------------------- |\n| SPECK32/64  | 32 bits    | 64 bits  | 22     | ARX (Addition, Rotation, XOR) |\n| SIMON32/64  | 32 bits    | 64 bits  | 32     | Balanced Feistel              |\n| SIMECK32/64 | 32 bits    | 64 bits  | 32     | Feistel                       |\n\n## Building and Running\n\nTo build and run the demo application:\n\n```bash\nzig build run -Doptimize=ReleaseFast\n```\n\nThis will display encryption/decryption examples for all three ciphers along with benchmark results.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nTo run all tests:\n\n```bash\nzig build test\n```\n\n## Security Notes\n\n⚠️ **Important Security Considerations**:\n\n1. **32-bit block size vulnerability**: These ciphers use 32-bit blocks, making them vulnerable to birthday attacks with just 2^16 ≈ 65,000 blocks. They should only be used in extremely constrained environments where this is an acceptable trade-off.\n\n2. **64-bit key size limitation**: The 64-bit key size is vulnerable to brute-force attacks with modern computational power.\n\n3. **Intended use**: These lightweight variants are intended for research, educational purposes, or extremely constrained environments where larger block sizes are not feasible.\n\nFor production applications requiring strong security, consider using other modern authenticated encryption schemes\n\n## References\n\n1.
