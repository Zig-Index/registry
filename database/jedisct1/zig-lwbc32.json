These ciphers are designed for use in resource-constrained environments and offer high performance in software implementations.\n\n## Ciphers Overview\n\n| Cipher       | Block Size | Key Size  | Rounds | Word Size | Structure                     |\n| ------------ | ---------- | --------- | ------ | --------- | ----------------------------- |\n| SPECK32/64   | 32 bits    | 64 bits   | 22     | 16-bit    | ARX (Addition, Rotation, XOR) |\n| SPECK64/128  | 64 bits    | 128 bits  | 27     | 32-bit    | ARX (Addition, Rotation, XOR) |\n| SIMON32/64   | 32 bits    | 64 bits   | 32     | 16-bit    | Balanced Feistel              |\n| SIMECK32/64  | 32 bits    | 64 bits   | 32     | 16-bit    | Feistel                       |\n\n## Building and Running\n\nTo build and run the demo application:\n\n```bash\nzig build run -Doptimize=ReleaseFast\n```\n\nThis will display encryption/decryption examples for all ciphers along with benchmark results.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nTo run all tests:\n\n```bash\nzig build test\n```\n\n## Security Notes\n\n**Important Security Considerations**:\n\n1. **32-bit block size vulnerability**: The 32-bit variants use small blocks, making them vulnerable to birthday attacks with just 2^16 blocks. They should only be used in extremely constrained environments.\n\n2. **64-bit block size**: SPECK64/128 provides better security margins (birthday bound at 2^32 blocks) and 128-bit key security against brute force.\n\n3. **Intended use**: These lightweight ciphers are intended for constrained environments where larger block sizes are not feasible.\n\nFor applications requiring strong security, consider using other authenticated encryption schemes.\n\n## References\n\n1.
