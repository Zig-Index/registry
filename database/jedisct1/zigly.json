Add `-Doptimize=ReleaseSmall` or `-Doptimize=ReleaseFast` to get very small or very fast module:\n\n```sh\nzig build-exe -target wasm32-wasi -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall example.zig\n```\n\nThe example above should not compile to more than 411 bytes.\n\nIf you are using a build file instead, define the target as `wasm32-wasi` in the `build.zig` file:\n\n```zig\nconst target = b.standardTargetOptions(.{ .default_target = .{ .cpu_arch = .wasm32, .os_tag = .wasi } });\n```\n\n...and build with `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall` or `-Doptimize=ReleaseFast` to get optimized modules.\n\n### Testing Fastly Compute modules\n\nThe easiest way to test the resulting modules is to use [Viceroy](https://github.com/fastly/Viceroy), a reimplementation of the Fastly API that runs locally.\n\n### Using Zigly\n\n#### Hello world!\n\n```zig\nconst downstream = try zigly.downstream();\nvar response = downstream.response;\ntry response.body.writeAll(\"Hello world!\");\ntry response.finish();\n```\n\n`downstream()` returns a type representing the initial connection, from a client to the proxy.\n\nThat type includes `response`, that can be used to send a response, as well as `request`, that can be used to inspect the incoming request.\n\nEvery function call may fail with an error from the `FastlyError` set.\n\nSlightly more complicated example:\n\n```zig\nconst downstream = try zigly.downstream();\nvar response = downstream.response;\n\nresponse.setStatus(201);\nresponse.headers.set(\"X-Example\", \"Header\");\n\ntry response.body.writeAll(\"Partial\");\ntry response.flush();\ntry response.body.writeAll(\"Response\");\ntry response.finish();\n\nvar logger = try zigly.Logger.open(\"logging_endpoint\");\ntry logger.write(\"Operation successful!\");\n```\n\nNote that calling `finish()` is always required in order to actually send a response to the client.\n\nBut realistically, most responses will either be simple redirects:\n\n```zig\nvar downstream = try zigly.downstream();\ntry downstream.redirect(302, \"https://www.perdu.com\");\n```\n\nor responding directly from the cache, proxying to the origin if the cached entry is nonexistent or expired:\n\n```zig\nvar downstream = try zigly.downstream();\ntry downstream.proxy(\"google\", \"www.google.com\");\n```\n\n#### Inspecting incoming requests\n\nApplications can read the body of an incoming requests as well as other informations such as the headers:\n\n```zig\nconst request = downstream.request;\nconst user_agent = try request.headers.get(allocator, \"user-agent\");\nif (request.isPost()) {\n    // method is POST, read the body until the end, up to 1000000 bytes\n    const body = try request.body.readAll(allocator, 1000000);\n}\n```\n\nAs usual in Zig, memory allocations are never hidden, and applications can choose the allocator they want to use for individual function calls.\n\n#### Making HTTP queries\n\nMaking HTTP queries is easy:\n\n```zig\nvar query = try zigly.http.Request.new(\"GET\", \"https://example.com\");\nvar response = try query.send(\"backend\");\nconst body = try response.body.readAll(allocator, 0);\n```\n\nArbitrary headers can be added the the outgoing `query`:\n\n```zig\ntry query.headers.set(\"X-Custom-Header\", \"Custom value\");\n```\n\nBody content can also be pushed, even as chunks:\n\n```zig\ntry query.body.write(\"X\");\ntry query.body.write(\"Y\");\ntry query.body.close();\n```\n\nAnd the resulting `response` contains `headers` and `body` properties, that can be inspected the same way as a downstream query.\n\n#### Cache override\n\nCaching can be disabled or configured on a per-query basis with `setCachingPolicy()`:\n\n```zig\ntry query.setCachingPolicy(.{ .serve_stale = 600, .pci = true });\n```\n\nAttributes include:\n\n- `no_cache`\n- `ttl`\n- `serve_stale`\n- `pci`\n- `surrogate_key`\n\n#### Pipes\n\nWith `pipe()`, the response sent to a client can be a direct copy of another response. The application will then act as a proxy, optionally also copying the original status and headers.\n\n```zig\nvar query = try zigly.http.Request.new(\"GET\", \"https://google.com\");\nvar upstream_response = try query.send(\"google\");\nconst downstream = try zigly.downstream();\ntry downstream.response.pipe(&upstream_response, true, true);\n```\n\n### Proxying\n\nProxying is even easier to use than pipes when a query should be sent unmodified (with the exception of the `Host` header) to the origin:\n\n```zig\nvar downstream = try zigly.downstream();\ntry downstream.proxy(\"google\", \"www.google.com\");\n```\n\nThe second parameter is optional. If `null`, the original `Host` header will not be modified.\n\n### Redirects\n\nRedirecting the client to another address can be done with a single function call on the downstream object:\n\n```zig\nconst downstream = try zigly.downstream();\ntry downstream.redirect(302, \"https://www.perdu.com\");\n```\n\n### Response decompression\n\nBy default, responses are left as-is. Which means that if compression (`Content-Encoding`) was accepted by the client, the response can be compressed.\n\nCalling `setAutoDecompressResponse(true)` on a `Request` object configures the Fastly Compute runtime to decompress gzip-encoded responses before streaming them to the application.\n\n#### Dictionaries\n\n```zig\nconst dict = try zigly.Dictionary.open(\"name\");\nconst value = try dict.get(allocator, \"key\");\n```\n\n#### Logging\n\n```zig\nconst logger = try zigly.Logger.open(\"endpoint\");\ntry logger.write(\"Log entry\");\n```\n\n## Deployment to Fastly's platform\n\nThe `fastly` command-line tool only supports compilation of Rust and AssemblyScript at the moment.\nHowever, it can still be used to upload pre-compiled code written in other languages, including Zig.\n\n1. Create a new project:\n\n```sh\nfastly compute init\n```\n\nFor the language, select `Other (pre-compiled WASM binary)`.\n\n2. Add a build script:\n\nAdd the following lines to the fastly.toml file:\n\n```toml\n[scripts]\nbuild = \"zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall -Dtarget=wasm32-wasi && mkdir -p bin && cp zig-out/bin/*.wasm bin/main.wasm\"\n```\n\n3. Compile and package the Fastly Compute module:\n\n```sh\nfastly compute build\n```\n\n4. Test locally\n\n```sh\nfastly compute serve\n```\n\n5. Deploy!\n\n```sh\nfastly compute deploy\n```\n\nIn order to deploy new versions, repeat steps 3 and 5.\n",
