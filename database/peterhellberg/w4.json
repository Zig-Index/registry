  "readme": "# w4 :zap:\n\nA small [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) ⚡ module, primarily meant for my own experiments with [WASM-4](https://wasm4.org/) 🎮\n\nBased on the [wasm4.zig template](https://github.com/aduros/wasm4/blob/main/cli/assets/templates/zig/src/wasm4.zig)\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> You might want to install the [w4-init](https://github.com/peterhellberg/w4-init) tool and use that instead of manually creating the files for your cart.\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can have `zig build` retrieve the `w4` module if you specify it as a dependency.\n\n### Create a `build.zig.zon` that looks something like this:\n```zig\n.{\n    .name = .w4_game,\n    .fingerprint = 0x9364c2ea98294635,\n    .version = \"0.0.0\",\n    .paths = .{\"\"},\n    .dependencies = .{\n        .w4 = .{\n            .url = \"https://github.com/peterhellberg/w4/archive/refs/tags/v0.1.3.tar.gz\",\n        },\n    },\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you leave out the hash then `zig build` will tell you that it is missing the hash, and what it is.\n> Another way to get the hash is to use `zig fetch`, this is probably how you _should_ do it :)\n\n### Then you can add the module in your `build.zig` like this:\n```zig\n// Add the w4 module to the executable\nexe.addModule(\"w4\", b.dependency(\"w4\", .{}).module(\"w4\"));\n```\n\n### In your `src/main.zig` you should now be able to:\n```zig\nconst w4 = @import(\"w4\");\n\nexport fn start() void {}\n\nexport fn update() void {\n    const hello = \"Hello from Zig!\";\n\n    w4.color(2);\n    w4.text(hello, 15, 11);\n    w4.color(3);\n    w4.text(hello, 16, 10);\n}\n```\n",
