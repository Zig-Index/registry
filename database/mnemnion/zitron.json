  "readme": "# Zitron\n\nZitron[^†] is an [LALR(1)][lalr] parser generator, closely based on\n[Lemon][lem], the parser generator D. Richard Hipp wrote for SQLite.  It\nhas been adopted and modified to produce Zig code.\n\nSo closely is Zitron based on Lemon, in fact, that it includes a\nfull port of Lemon, which has been tested and produces byte-for-byte\nidentical output for numerous Lemon grammars, including that of SQLite\nitself.  While I can think of no actual advantage to using `lemon.zig`\nrather than `lemon.c`, translating the former was an essential step in\nwriting the latter, and I saw no reason to leave it stranded in the\ncommit history.  Let it serve as an artifact showing the fidelity with\nwhich this translation was prepared.  Any bugs in Zitron are almost sure\nto be of my own doing, and, with decent confidence, transpired after the\ntranslation of `lemon.zig`.\n\n## Using Zitron\n\nAs [Yet Another Yet Another Compiler-Compiler][yacc][^‡], Zitron is a complete\nDSL for declaring a parser, and actions to go along with recognition.  A\n[detailed manual](/doc/zitron.md) is included, itself adopted from [the\noriginal][og].\n\nA tokenizer will be necessary.  If you're reading this[^※], a companion lexer\ngenerator does not exist.  It's certainly tractable to roll your own by\nhand.  It may also interest you to know that [re2c][re2c] is able to generate\nZig code, although not, at the time of writing, using labeled switch\ncontinue format.\n\n### Licensing\n\nLemon is in the public domain.  Whether a close technical translation is\neven entitled to a separate copyright is somewhat unclear; for the avoidance\nof doubt, `lemon.zig` is also dedicated to the public domain.\n\nZitron itself is licensed `BSD 0`, which is morally equivalent, and\ncompatible with more international licensing régimes.\n\nSome of the Lemon grammars in the `samples/` directory have their own\nlicenses, which you will find in `samples/licenses/`.\n\n### Editing\n\nThe Zitron format has a [Tree-sitter grammar](https://github.com/mnemnion/tree-sitter-zitron),\nfor your editing convenience.  It's still a bit rough around the edges, so you'll\nneed to manually integrate it with your editor of choice. Smoother user experiences\nmay be forthcoming.\n\n## Future Work\n\nThis project has the great advantage of standing upon the shoulders of a\ngiant.  Lemon parsers run on every smartphone, the great majority of PCs\nand servers, Naval vessels, embedded systems, and much else; the design\nhas proven its merit a myriad times over.\n\nAnd yet I have the temerity to contemplate some changes, to improve the\ndeveloper experience, even perhaps the user experience, of writing and\nrunning Zitron grammars (respectively).  Some of those changes already\nexist!\n\nIt's too early to guarantee that every Zitron grammar written today\nwill be forward-compatible with every Zitron release, down to the last\nbuild flag.  Decent chance it will be, though.  If you find yourself\nrelying on Zitron in a project, I would be most pleased to hear about it,\nand will keep that in consideration in the event of any breaking change.\n\nMost of what I'm contemplating is strictly additive, in any case.  No\npromises, no warranty, as the Lemon manual puts it:\n\n> If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.\n\n[lalr]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LALR_parser\n[lem]: https://sqlite.org/lemon.html\n[yacc]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacc\n[og]: https://sqlite.org/src/doc/trunk/doc/lemon.html\n[re2c]: https://re2c.org/manual/manual_zig.html\n\n\n[^†]: The name Zitron is a sort of pan-European compromise between\nseveral spellings of \"citron\", a word which refers to a different citrus\nentirely in English, but to the lemon in those European languages where\nit doesn't sound like 'lemon'.  This artifice, much like the EU, is\nguaranteed to please no one.\n\n[^※]: Safe bet\n\n[^‡]: Which I suppose makes me yet another yet another compiler-compiler\ncompiler.  Hazard of the trade!  Quite the yacc shave, I must admit.\n",
