  "readme": "# stl-loader-zig\n\nA tiny simple zig library for loading STL files with support for both ASCII and binary representations. \n\n## Usage\nExample usage provided in [example.zig](src/example.zig):\n\n```c\nconst stlLoader = @import(\"stl-loader\");\n\n...\n\nconst filepath: []const u8 = \"file.stl\";\n\nvar gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\nconst allocator = gpa.allocator();\ndefer _ = gpa.deinit();\n\nconst mesh = try stlLoader.load_stl(allocator, filepath);\ndefer allocator.free(mesh);\n// do stuff with mesh\n```\n\nLoading by default should be done thru dispatcher function, which takes a path for the file **relative to the cwd** and automatically chooses which implementation of the reader to use. If the type of the STL file is known at compile time, or you wish to dispatch the functions manually, **note the offsets for the reader required before calling the functions.**\n\n## Notes\n- Apparently normals may sometimes be left blank by the software that generates the stl files, so you may wanna recalculate them (i have not encountered this in the wild yet however)!\n",
