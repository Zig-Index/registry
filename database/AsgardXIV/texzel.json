  "readme": "# Texzel\n\nTexzel is a pure Zig library for texture encoding/decoding (compression/decompression) with no dependencies.\n\nIt is currently focused on the BCn codecs as well as converting between different raw pixel formats.\n\n## Supported Formats\n| Format | Decode | Encode | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Raw | ✅ | ✅ | Supports any arbitrary pixel layout and can swizzle when converting. Some common ones are defined for convenience. |\n| BC1 (S3TC DXT1) | ✅ | ✅ | BC1a is supported, any texel with alpha < 255 will be treated as fully transparent |\n| BC2 (S3TC DXT3) | ✅ | ✅ | |\n| BC3 (S3TC DXT5) | ✅ | ✅ | |\n| BC4 (RGTC1) | ✅ | ✅ | |\n| BC5 (RGTC2) | ✅ | ✅ | | \n| BC6 (BPTC_FLOAT) | ✅ | ✅ | | \n| BC7 (BPTC)  | ✅ | ✅ | |\n\n## Current State\nTexzel is still very early in development and the API is not stable, the code is not particularly clean or efficient.\n\nIt works with textures I've tested but it's possible there are bugs in speciifc modes of specific codecs. Please open an issue if you find one!\n\nTexzel does not currently support file formats, as such you must provide raw buffers to compress/decompress. I'm still uncertain if adding support for DDS/KTX2 etc should be in scope for this project or not.\n\nContributions are very welcome!\n\n## Adding to your project\n1. Add texzel to your build.zig.zon\n```\nzig fetch --save git+https://github.com/AsgardXIV/texzel\n```\n\n2. Add the dependency to your project, for example:\n```zig\nconst texzel_dependency = b.dependency(\"texzel\", .{\n  .target = target,\n  .optimize = optimize,\n});\n\nexe_mod.addImport(\"texzel\", texzel_dependency.module(\"texzel\"));\n```\n\n## Usage Example\n```zig\nconst allocator = ...;\n\n// Import Texzel\nconst texzel = @import(\"texzel\");\n\n// Load a raw rgba image\nconst file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(\"resources/ziggy.rgba\", .{ .mode = .read_only });\ndefer file.close();\nconst raw_buffer = try file.readToEndAlloc(std.testing.allocator, 2 << 20);\ndefer allocator.free(raw_buffer);\n\n// Image dimensions\nconst dimensions = texzel.core.Dimensions{\n    .width = 512,\n    .height = 512,\n};\n\n// Create a raw image data instance from the buffer\nconst raw_image = try texzel.rawImageFromBuffer(\n    allocator,\n    texzel.pixel_formats.RGBA8U,\n    dimensions,\n    raw_buffer,\n); \ndefer raw_image.deinit();\n\n// Compress to BC1\nconst compressed_buffer = try texzel.encode(\n    allocator,\n    .bc1,\n    texzel.pixel_formats.RGBA8U,\n    raw_image,\n    .{},\n); \ndefer allocator.free(compressed_buffer);\n\n// Decompress to RawImage but in BGRA8U this time\nconst new_raw_image = try texzel.decode(\n    allocator,\n    .bc1,\n    texzel.pixel_formats.BGRA8U,\n    dimensions,\n    compressed_buffer,\n    .{},\n);\ndefer new_raw_image.deinit();\n\n// Access the new raw buffer\nconst new_raw_buffer = new_raw_image.asBuffer();\n_ = new_raw_buffer; // Do something\n```\n\n## License\nTexzel is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n\nLicenses for third-party software and assets can be found [here](THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md).\n",
