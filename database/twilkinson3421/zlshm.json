  "readme": "# zlshm\n\nA simple shared library for reading from shared memory on Windows. Support for Linux is planned in the future.\n\n## Usage\n\nUse the provided `.dll` library, which can be found in the releases seciton.\n\nThis library was originally written for use\nwith Deno's _ffi_ functionality, but can be used with any language that supports loading shared lirbaries.\n\n## Symbols\n\n### `open`\n\nOpens a shared memory file. Returns a windows `HANDLE` to the file.\n\n| Argument | Type   | Description                                                                        |\n| -------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| name     | string | The name of the shared memory file to open. This must be null-terminated UTF-16LE. |\n| log_err  | bool   | Whether to log errors to stderr.                                                   |\n\n### `close`\n\nCloses a shared memory file. Returns the return code of `CloseHandle`.\n\n| Argument | Type     | Description                                      |\n| -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |\n| handle   | `HANDLE` | The `HANDLE` of the shared memory file to close. |\n\n### `read`\n\nReads data from a shared memory file. Returns -1 if `MapViewOfFile` fails,\notherwise the return code of `UnmapViewOfFile`.\n\n| Argument | Type     | Description                                                                         |\n| -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| handle   | `HANDLE` | The `HANDLE` of the shared memory file to read from.                                |\n| buf      | pointer  | The buffer to read the data into.                                                   |\n| len      | usize    | The number of bytes to map. Must be less than or equal to the length of the buffer. |\n| log_err  | bool     | Whether to log errors to stderr.                                                    |\n\n## Building\n\nThis library is written and built using Zig version _0.14.0-dev.2577+271452d22_ (_2024.11.0-mach_).\nRun `zig build` to build the library locally (requires Zig to be installed). If you are not using Windows,\nyou should add `-Dtarget=x86_64-windows` to the build command (Obviously you will require Windows to use the library).\n",
