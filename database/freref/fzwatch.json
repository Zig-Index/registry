The API is defined as follows:\n\n```zig\npub const Event = enum { modified };\npub const Callback = fn (context: *anyopaque, event: Event) void;\npub const Opts = struct { latency: f16 = 1.0 };\n\npub fn init(allocator: std.mem.Allocator) !Watcher;\npub fn deinit(self: *Watcher) void;\npub fn addFile(self: *Watcher, path: []const u8) !void;\npub fn removeFile(self: *Watcher, path: []const u8) !void;\npub fn setCallback(self: *Watcher, callback: Callback) void;\npub fn start(self: *Watcher, opts: Opts) !void;\npub fn stop(self: *Watcher) !void;\n```\n\n### Testing\n\nRun the test suite:\n\n```sh\nzig build test\n```\n",
