Add `protobuf` to your `build.zig.zon`.  \n    ```sh\n    zig fetch --save \"git+https://github.com/Arwalk/zig-protobuf#master\"\n    ```\n1. Use the `protobuf` module. In your `build.zig`'s build function, add the dependency as module before\n`b.installArtifact(exe)`.\n    ```zig\n    pub fn build(b: *std.Build) !void {\n        // first create a build for the dependency\n        const protobuf_dep = b.dependency(\"protobuf\", .{\n            .target = target,\n            .optimize = optimize,\n        });\n\n        // and lastly use the dependency as a module\n        exe.root_module.addImport(\"protobuf\", protobuf_dep.module(\"protobuf\"));\n    }\n    ```\n\n## Generating .zig files out of .proto definitions\n\nYou can do this programatically as a compilation step for your application. The following snippet shows how to create a `zig build gen-proto` command for your project.\n\n```zig\nconst protobuf = @import(\"protobuf\");\n\npub fn build(b: *std.Build) !void {\n    // first create a build for the dependency\n    const protobuf_dep = b.dependency(\"protobuf\", .{\n        .target = target,\n        .optimize = optimize,\n    });\n    \n    ...\n\n    const gen_proto = b.step(\"gen-proto\", \"generates zig files from protocol buffer definitions\");\n\n    const protoc_step = protobuf.RunProtocStep.create(protobuf_dep.builder, target, .{\n        // out directory for the generated zig files\n        .destination_directory = b.path(\"src/proto\"),\n        .source_files = &.{\n            \"protocol/all.proto\",\n        },\n        .include_directories = &.{},\n    });\n\n    gen_proto.dependOn(&protoc_step.step);\n}\n```\n\n-------\n\nThe zig-protobuf logo is licensed under the Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).\n\nThe logo is inspired by the [official mascots](https://github.com/ziglang/logo?tab=readme-ov-file#official-mascots) of the Zig programming language, themselves licensed under the Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\n\nOriginal art by vivisector.\n\n-------\n\nIf you're really bored, you can buy me a coffee here.\n\n[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/N4N7VMS4F)\n",

      "body": "## IMPORTANT BREAKING CHANGE\r\n\r\nAn encoding error was identified for `int32` protobuf fields. Any other fields (`sint32`, `uint32`, ...) are not concerned.\r\n\r\n### The problem\r\n\r\nI assumed wrongly that protobuf would chooses the smallest representation for int32 fields, but the specification is clear: int32 fields are actually encoded as int64 fields in the wire format. This means that negative values are encoded with 10 bytes, not 5. Sadly, zig-protobuf was encoding with 5 bytes, which meant that other (and more correct) implementations of protobuf would not decode them as their actual values.\r\n\r\n### If you have `int32` fields in your proto messages\r\n\r\n#### If your software only communicates with another zig-protobuf implementation\r\n\r\nUpdate zig-protobuf to this version or up on all your systems.\r\n\r\n#### If your software sends `int32` data to another implementation\r\n\r\nCheck if your messages have used negative values, ensure the other system did not have any problem.\r\nIf negative values were never used, you do not have any problem. Update zig-protobuf asap.\r\n\r\n#### If your software receives `int32` from another implementation\r\n\r\nNegatives values would have not been properly decoded and an error would have been returned. You probably would have noticed already.\r\n\r\n#### If you have saved to disk/database encoded protobuf data with `int32` fields that could contain negative values\r\n\r\nfirst: backup everything.\r\n\r\nthen let's say you have this .proto file\r\n\r\n```protobuf\r\nmessage AnExample{\r\n  int32 a_field = 1;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. Create a new recovery .protofile with equivalent fields but `int32` are now `int64`\r\n\r\n```protobuf\r\nmessage AnExampleForRecovery{\r\n  int64 a_field = 1;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. read from disk/database the data using the **old** zig-protobuf, and save it back using the new recovery message.\r\n3. update zig-protobuf\r\n4. read from disk/database with the fixed zig-protobuf and the new recovery message, save it with your original .proto message\r\n\r\n#### If you don't know what to do\r\n\r\nI'll do my best to give some support for people who could have been affected. I can be contacted in the discussions on this repository, or you can find me on the official zig discord server.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nNote: json is a work in progress subject, consider it beta.\r\n\r\n### What's Changed\r\n* Change std.debug.print -> std.log.warn by @Detegr in https://github.com/Arwalk/zig-protobuf/pull/51\r\n* JSON (de)serialization by @librolibro in https://github.com/Arwalk/zig-protobuf/pull/49\r\n* Allow for external protoc by @BonusPlay in https://github.com/Arwalk/zig-protobuf/pull/66\r\n* 56 Errors with `Unknown field received in ....` by @Arwalk in https://github.com/Arwalk/zig-protobuf/pull/63\r\n* fix: memory leak when decoding Lists of Bytes by @kantai-chris in https://github.com/Arwalk/zig-protobuf/pull/68\r\n* Fix: prevent unsafe cast on decoding by @AlpaGit  in https://github.com/Arwalk/zig-protobuf/pull/72\r\n* #74 `dupe()` methods fail to compile by @Arwalk in https://github.com/Arwalk/zig-protobuf/pull/75\r\n* fix: Convert OOB enums from panics to runtime errors by @hans-tvs in https://github.com/Arwalk/zig-protobuf/pull/76\r\n* 84 `encode()` fails to compile by @Arwalk in https://github.com/Arwalk/zig-protobuf/pull/85\r\n* Fix integer encoding by @Arwalk in https://github.com/Arwalk/zig-protobuf/pull/86\r\n\r\n### New Contributors\r\n* @Detegr made their first contribution in https://github.com/Arwalk/zig-protobuf/pull/51\r\n* @librolibro made their first contribution in https://github.com/Arwalk/zig-protobuf/pull/49\r\n* @BonusPlay made their first contribution in https://github.com/Arwalk/zig-protobuf/pull/66\r\n* @kantai-chris made their first contribution in https://github.com/Arwalk/zig-protobuf/pull/68\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Arwalk/zig-protobuf/compare/v1.0.6...v2.0.0",
