Designed for concurrent applications requiring efficient, thread-safe FIFO (First-In-First-Out) data structures.\n\n# Features\n- Lock-Free Design: Utilizes atomic operations to enable multiple threads to enqueue and dequeue without traditional locking mechanisms.\n\n- Michael-Scott Algorithm: Implements the well-known non-blocking queue algorithm for safe concurrent access.\n\n- Generic Implementation: Supports queues of any data type through Zig's generics.\n\n- Allocator Agnostic: Compatible with any allocator conforming to Zig's Allocator interface.\n\n- Minimal Dependencies: Built solely with Zig's standard library, ensuring ease of integration.\n\n# Installation\n\n## To include Zig-LockFreeQueue in your project:\n\n### Clone the Repository:\n```git clone https://github.com/Joseph-Matteo-Scorsone/Zig-LockFreeQueue.git```\n\n### Integrate into Your build.zig:\n```\nconst lockfree_queue = b.createModule(.{\n        .root_source_file = b.path(\"Zig-LockFreeQueue/src/lockFreeQueue.zig\"),\n});\n\nexe_mod.addImport(\"lockfree_queue\", lockfree_queue);\n```\n### Make sure \"Zig-LockFreeQueue/src\" is the actual path to the cloned repository.\n\n# Usage\nHere's a basic example of how to use Zig-LockFreeQueue:\n```\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst LockFreeQueue = @import(\"lockfree_queue\").LockFreeQueue;\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    const allocator = std.heap.page_allocator;\n    var queue = try LockFreeQueue(i32).init(allocator);\n    defer queue.deinit();\n\n    try queue.enqueue(42);\n\n    std.debug.print(\"Value: {any}\\n\", .{queue.peek()});\n    \n    std.debug.print(\"Dequeued value: {any}\\n\", .{queue.dequeue()});\n\n    std.debug.print(\"Queue is empty.\\n\", .{});\n}\n```\n\n# API\n```init(allocator: *Allocator) !LockFreeQueue(T)```\nInitializes a new lock-free queue for type T using the provided allocator.\n\n```deinit(self: *LockFreeQueue(T)) void```\nDeinitializes the queue, releasing any allocated resources.\n\n```enqueue(self: *LockFreeQueue(T), value: T) !void```\nAdds a value to the end of the queue.\n\n```peek(self: *LockFreeQueue(T)) ?void```\nReturns the value at the front of the queue without removing it, or null if the queue is empty.\n\n```dequeue(self: *LockFreeQueue(T)) ?T```\nRemoves and returns a value from the front of the queue. Returns null if the queue is empty.\n\n# Testing\n## To run the test suite:\n\n```zig build test```\nEnsure that all tests pass to verify the correctness of the implementation.\n\n# Contributing\nContributions are welcome!
