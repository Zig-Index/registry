  "readme": "# zimalloc\n\nzimalloc is general purpose allocator for Zig, inspired by [mimalloc](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc).\n\n## Status\n\nThis project is under development and should currently be considered experimental/exploratory; there\nis no documentation and it has not been battle-tested. In particular there may be issues with\nmulti-threaded workloads. Contributions of any kind (PRs, suggestions for improvements, resources or\nideas related to benchmarking or testing) are welcome.\n\nThe allocator is significantly faster than `std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{})` but should not\n(yet) be expected to be competitive with other established general purpose allocators.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use the allocator in your own project you can use the Zig package manager by putting this in your\n`build.zig`\n```zig\npub fn build(b: *std.Build) void {\n    // -- snip --\n    const zimalloc = b.dependency(\"zimalloc\").module(\"zimalloc\"); // get the zimalloc module\n    // -- snip --\n    exe.addModule(zimalloc); // add the zimalloc module as a dependency of exe\n    // -- snip --\n}\n```\nand this to the dependencies section of your `build.zig.zon`\n```zig\n    .zimalloc = .{\n        .url = \"https://github.com/dweiller/zimalloc/archive/[[COMMIT_SHA]].tar.gz\"\n    },\n```\nwhere `[[COMMIT_SHA]]` should be replaced with full SHA of the desired revision. You can then import\nand initialise an instance of the allocator as follows:\n```zig\nconst zimalloc = @import(\"zimalloc\");\npub fn main() !void {\n    var gpa: zimalloc.Allocator(.{}) = .{};\n    defer gpa.deinit();\n\n    const allocator = gpa.allocator();\n    // -- snip --\n}\n```\n\n### Shared library\n\nThere is a shared library that can be used for overriding standard libc allocation functions.\nIt can be accessed from your `build.zig` like so:\n```zig\npub fn build(b: *std.Build) void {\n    // -- snip --\n    const libzimalloc = b.dependency(\"zimalloc\").artifact(\"zimalloc\"); // get the zimalloc shared library\n    // -- snip --\n    exe.linkLibrary(zimalloc); // link to libzimalloc\n    // -- snip --\n}\n```\n\nIf you just want to build the shared library and use it outside the Zig build system, you can build\nit with the `libzimalloc` or `install` steps, for example:\n```sh\nzig build libzimalloc -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n  - The current implementation works on Linux, with other systems untested.\n  - The main suite of tests currently used is `https://github.com/daanx/mimalloc-bench`\n    which are run using `LD_PRELOAD`. Not all tests have been tried, but all those that have been tested\n    run successfully.\n  - No attempt has been made to make the allocator signal-safe.\n",
