If your program is linked against the\nDLL, you may define the `WINPTHREADS_USE_DLLIMPORT` macro to add the\n`dllimport` attribute to all APIs, which makes function calls to them a\nbit more efficient.\n\n\nHow to use\n---------\n\n**Requires:** zig v0.12.0 or v0.13.0\n\n\n* Make a project:\n\n```bash\nmkdir your-project-folder\ncd your-project-folder \n# generate both (exe and lib template w/ build.zig & build.zig.zon)\nzig init\n# get latest version (commit-tag or branch)\nzig fetch git+https://github.com/kassane/winpthreads-zigbuild#main\n```\n\n* Add on current project:\n\n```bash\n# (w/ build.zig & build.zig.zon)\ncd your-project-folder\n# get latest version\nzig fetch git+https://github.com/kassane/winpthreads-zigbuild#main # or #commit-tag\n```\n\n**Warn:** `main` branch changes commit hashes.\n",
