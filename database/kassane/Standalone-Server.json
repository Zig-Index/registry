  "readme": "# Standalone-Server\n\nA very simple, fast, multithreaded, platform independent HTTP and HTTPS server and client library implemented using C++17 and Asio standalone. Created to be an easy way to make REST resources available from C++ applications.\n\n## Requires\n\n- [Zig](https://ziglang.org/download) toolchain v0.14.0 or master\n\n## Features\n\n* Asynchronous request handling\n* Thread pool if needed\n* Platform independent\n* HTTP/1.1 supported, including persistent connections\n* HTTPS supported\n* Chunked transfer encoding and server-sent events\n* Can set timeouts for request/response and content\n* Can set max request/response size\n* Sending outgoing messages is thread safe\n* Client creates necessary connections and perform reconnects when needed\n\n## Usage\n\nSee:\n[http_examples.cpp](examples/http_examples.cpp)\nor\n[https_examples.cpp](examples/https_examples.cpp) for example usage.\nThe following server resources are setup using regular expressions to match request paths:\n* `POST /string` - responds with the posted string.\n* `POST /json` - parses the request content as JSON, and responds with some of the parsed values.\n* `GET /info` - responds with information extracted from the request.\n* `GET /match/([0-9]+)` - matches for instance `/match/123` and responds with the matched number `123`.\n* `GET /work` - starts a thread, simulating heavy work, and responds when the work is done.\n* `GET` - a special default_resource handler is called when a request path does not match any of the above resources.\nThis resource responds with the content of files in the `web/`-folder if the request path identifies one of these files.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n* standalone Asio\n* For HTTPS: OpenSSL libraries\n\nInstallation instructions for the dependencies needed to compile the examples on a selection of platforms can be seen below.\nDefault build with standalone Asio is assumed.\n\n### Debian based distributions\n\n```sh\nsudo apt-get install libssl-dev\n```\n\n### Arch Linux based distributions\n\n```sh\nsudo pacman -S openssl\n```\n\n### MacOS\n\n```sh\nbrew install openssl\n```\n\n## Compile and run\n\n\nChoose **Release_Type** = (ReleaseSafe|ReleaseFast|ReleaseSmall)\n\nCompile with a C++17 compliant compiler (like `zig c++` eql to `clang++ -stdlib=libc++ -fuse-ld=lld`):\n```sh\nzig build -Doptimize={Release_type}\n```\n\n### HTTP\n\nRun the server and client examples: `zig build http_examples -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe`\n\nDirect your favorite browser to for instance http://localhost:8080/\n\n### HTTPS\n\nBefore running the server, an RSA private key (server.key) and an SSL certificate (server.crt) must be created.\n\nRun the server and client examples: `zig build https_examples -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe`\n\nDirect your favorite browser to for instance https://localhost:8080/\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome, either by creating an issue or a merge request.\nHowever, before you create a new issue or merge request, please search for previous similar issues or requests.\nA response will normally be given within a few days.\n\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nMain author: [Ole Christian Eidheim](https://github.com/eidheim) - original project [Simple-Web-Server - Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/eidheim/Simple-Web-Server)",
