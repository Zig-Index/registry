  "readme": "# Zig Regex\n\nA fairly quick regex implementation done a while back for learning purposes, I'll just clean it up and put it out there.\nThis one is largely implemented with tagged unions and recursive descent rather than a state machine or a \nbyte gobbler so it shows you actually can write zig programs in a fairly functional manner. \n\nIn fact it's pretty damn nice for it.\n\nYou can test the library with \n\n```zig\nzig test gregex.zig\n```\n\nUsecases can be found in the .zig file itself,\n\nbut here's a simple usecase.\n\n```zig\n    var test_restr = \"name: *(.*)\\\\((.*)\\\\)$\";\n\n    var find = try re_find_once(test_restr, \"date: 2077-06-24 name: adam jensen (occupation: killa)\\n\", alloc);\n    defer find.deinit(); // find has an arraylist of regex objects, this should be de-initialized when out of scope.\n\n    print(\"{s}\\n\", .{ find.text }); // This will print out the entire string\n    \n    // the result supports groups\n    print(\"find.groups.items[1] = '{s}':\\n\", .{find.groups.items[0].text});\n    print(\"find.groups.items[2] = '{s}':\\n\", .{find.groups.items[0].text});\n```\n\nin terms of sequences, a few of the most commonly supported sequences are supported.\n\n- `*, +, ?` : capture mode operators, respectively; zero or more, one or more, zero or one\n- `()` : create a match group (does not support nesting)\n- `[]`: or match group (match any union of elements within)\n- `a-z`: sequence range match\n- predefined semantic groups:\n    - `\\s` : whitespace (capital version is inverted)\n    - `\\w` : alphanumeric\n    - `\\d` : digits\n- `!`: Single term negation negates matches that are a single term. does not work on `()` groups or. but will work on or-groups.\n    - negative look-ahead is not supported.\n\nNote: this is the first thing I've ever actually written in zig so there's a few growing pains in visible in the code.\n",
