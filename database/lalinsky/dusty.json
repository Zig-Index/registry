  "readme": "Dusty is a simple HTTP server built on top of [zio](https://github.com/lalinsky/zio) and [llhttp](https://github.com/nodejs/llhttp).\nThe API is very much inspired by Karl Seguin's [http.zig](https://github.com/karlseguin/http.zig), which is a great project and\nI would be happy using that, if I didn't need to run multiple network services inside the same application. \n\nThis project is in very early stages, don't use it unless you want to experiment or perhaps even contribute.\n\n## Features\n- Asynchronous I/O for multiple concurrent connections on a single CPU thread\n- Requests handled in lightweight coroutines\n- Router with support for parameters and wildcards\n- Supports HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1\n- Supports chunked transfer encoding in both request/response bodies\n- Request/keepalive timeouts via coroutine auto-cancellation\n\n## Example\n\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst zio = @import(\"zio\");\nconst http = @import(\"dusty\");\n\nconst AppContext = struct {\n    rt: *zio.Runtime,\n};\n\nfn handleUser(ctx: *AppContext, req: *http.Request, res: *http.Response) !void {\n    ctx.rt.sleep(100); // simulate some work\n    const user_id = req.params.get(\"id\") orelse \"guest\";\n    try res.json(.{ .id = user_id, .name = \"John Doe\" }, .{});\n}\n\n// ...\n\nfn runServer(allocator: std.mem.Allocator, rt: *zio.Runtime) !void {\n    var ctx: AppContext = .{ .rt = rt };\n\n    var server = http.Server(AppContext).init(allocator, .{}, &ctx);\n    defer server.deinit();\n\n    server.router.get(\"/user/:id\", handleUser);\n    server.router.get(\"/file/*path\", handleFile);\n\n    const addr = try zio.net.IpAddress.parseIp(\"127.0.0.1\", 8080);\n    try server.listen(rt, addr);\n}\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\n    defer _ = gpa.deinit();\n    const allocator = gpa.allocator();\n\n    var rt = try zio.Runtime.init(allocator, .{});\n    defer rt.deinit();\n\n    try rt.runUntilComplete(runServer, .{ allocator, rt }, .{});\n}\n```\n",
