Supports TCP, UDP, Unix sockets, raw IP sockets. DNS lookups.\n- Fully asynchronous file I/O on Linux, partially (read/write) on Windows, simulated using auxiliary thread pool on other systems.\n- Safe cancelation support for all operations.\n- Structured concurrency using task groups.\n- Synchronization primitives, including more advanced ones, like channels.\n- Low-level event loop access for integrating with existing C libraries.\n\n## Ecosystem\n\nThe following libraries use zio for networking and concurrency:\n\n- [HTTP server and client](https://github.com/lalinsky/dusty)\n- [PostgreSQL client](https://github.com/lalinsky/pg.zig)\n- [Redis client](https://github.com/lalinsky/redis.zig)\n- [NATS client](https://github.com/lalinsky/nats.zig)\n- [Memcached client](https://github.com/lalinsky/memcached.zig)\n\n## Installation\n\n1) Add zio as a dependency in your `build.zig.zon`:\n\n```bash\nzig fetch --save \"git+https://github.com/lalinsky/zio#v0.8.2\"\n```\n\n2) In your `build.zig`, add the `zio` module as a dependency to your program:\n\n```zig\nconst zio = b.dependency(\"zio\", .{\n    .target = target,\n    .optimize = optimize,\n});\n\n// the executable from your call to b.addExecutable(...)\nexe.root_module.addImport(\"zio\", zio.module(\"zio\"));\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nBasic TCP echo server:\n\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst zio = @import(\"zio\");\n\nfn handleClient(stream: zio.net.Stream) !void {\n    defer stream.close();\n\n    var read_buffer: [1024]u8 = undefined;\n    var reader = stream.reader(&read_buffer);\n\n    var write_buffer: [1024]u8 = undefined;\n    var writer = stream.writer(&write_buffer);\n\n    while (true) {\n        const line = reader.interface.takeDelimiterInclusive('\\n') catch |err| switch (err) {\n            error.EndOfStream => break,\n            else => return err,\n        };\n        try writer.interface.writeAll(line);\n        try writer.interface.flush();\n    }\n}\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\n    defer _ = gpa.deinit();\n\n    const rt = try zio.Runtime.init(gpa.allocator(), .{});\n    defer rt.deinit();\n\n    const addr = try zio.net.IpAddress.parseIp4(\"127.0.0.1\", 8080);\n    const server = try addr.listen(.{});\n    defer server.close();\n\n    std.log.info(\"Listening on {f}\", .{server.socket.address});\n\n    var group: zio.Group = .init;\n    defer group.cancel();\n\n    while (true) {\n        const stream = try server.accept();\n        errdefer stream.close();\n\n        try group.spawn(handleClient, .{stream});\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSee `examples/*.zig` for more examples.\n\n## Building\n\n```bash\n# Build the library and examples\nzig build\n\n# Run tests\nzig build test\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the [MIT license].\n\n[MIT license]: https://github.com/lalinsky/zio/blob/main/LICENSE\n",

      "body": "This is a major release with many changes. It has been in development for a while, but I finally decided\nto release it.\n\nFirst of all, the codebase has been relicensed under the MIT license.\n\nI replaced `libxev` with a custom I/O event loop, that has better cross-platform support,\nnatively supports multiple threads each running its own event loop, supports more filesystem operations,\nconsistent timer behavior across platforms, grouped operations, and more. This is avialable in `zio.ev` and\ncan be also used separately from the rest of the library. This switch was motivated by with Zig 0.16 which\nremoved a lot of lower-level I/O APIs, so it was hard to upgrade `libxev`, but in the end, I'm glad I did it.\nThe new event loop is more feature complete, more efficient, and more flexible.\n\nThe coroutine library has also been restructured, and it's now available in `zio.coro`.\nI've added support for riscv64 and loongarch64 CPUs. Stack allocation has been completel rewritten,\nit now properly allocates vitual memory from the operating system, marks guard pages and we also have\nsignal handlers for growing the virtual memory reservation on demand. Coroutines now start with 64KiB\nof stack space, and grow dynamically as needed.\n\nThe `zio.select()` function has been completely rewritten, and now support comptime-based support\nfor waiting on things other than tasks. For example, you can use it to race two channel reads,\nor add timeout support to any operation that doesn't handle timeouts natively.\n\nThere is now `zio.AutoCancel` for automatically cancelling the current task after a timeout.\nThis is useful when you want to call an arbitrary function that may take a long time to complete,\nand you want to make sure it gets cancelled if it doesn't complete in a timely manner, for example,\nin HTTP request handlers.\n\nMany networking APIs now have direct timeout support. Additionally, in `zio.net.Stream.Reader` and\n`zio.net.Stream.Writer`, you can call `setTimeout()` and it will make sure the underlaying \n`std.Io.Reader` or `std.Io.Writer` doesn't block for too long. This is similar to\nPOSIX socket read/write timeouts, but also supports absolute deadlines.\n\nMany new APIs have been added, for compatibility with the future `std.Io` API.\n\nInternally, I've done a lot of refactoring to prepare for a future scheduler replacement.\nI've started with project with an event-loop-per-thread model, and I still think it's the better\napproach for servers, but I'm slowly migrating to a hybrid model, where tasks primarily stick to\nthe thread they were created on, but also can be freely moved to other threads,\nwhen it's beneficial for load balancing.",
