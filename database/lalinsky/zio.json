If you want to use the library with the development version of Zig with the `std.Io` interface, use the [`zig-0.16`] branch. Keep in mind that the development version Zig has frequent breaking changes, so the branch might not be always up to date. Contributions are welcome.*\n\n[`zig-0.16`]: https://github.com/lalinsky/zio/tree/zig-0.16\n\n## Features\n\n- Support for Linux (`io_uring`, `epoll`), Windows (`iocp`), macOS (`kqueue`), most BSDs (`kqueue`), and many other systems (`poll`).\n- User-mode coroutine context switching for `x86_64`, `aarch64`, `riscv64` and `loongarch64` architectures.\n- Growable stacks for the coroutines implemented by auto-extending virtual memory reservations.\n- Multi-threaded coroutine scheduler.\n- Fully asynchronous network I/O on all systems.\n- Asynchronous file I/O on Linux and Windows, simulated using auxiliary thread pool on other systems.\n- Cancelation support for all operations.\n- Structured concurrency using task groups.\n- Synchronization primitives, including more advanced ones, like channels.\n\n## Installation\n\n1) Add zio as a dependency in your `build.zig.zon`:\n\n```bash\nzig fetch --save \"git+https://github.com/lalinsky/zio\"\n```\n\n2) In your `build.zig`, add the `zio` module as a dependency to your program:\n\n```zig\nconst zio = b.dependency(\"zio\", .{\n    .target = target,\n    .optimize = optimize,\n});\n\n// the executable from your call to b.addExecutable(...)\nexe.root_module.addImport(\"zio\", zio.module(\"zio\"));\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nBasic TCP echo server:\n\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst zio = @import(\"zio\");\n\nfn handleClient(rt: *zio.Runtime, stream: zio.net.Stream) !void {\n    defer stream.close(rt);\n\n    var read_buffer: [1024]u8 = undefined;\n    var reader = stream.reader(rt, &read_buffer);\n\n    var write_buffer: [1024]u8 = undefined;\n    var writer = stream.writer(rt, &write_buffer);\n\n    while (true) {\n        const line = reader.interface.takeDelimiterInclusive('\\n') catch |err| switch (err) {\n            error.EndOfStream => break,\n            else => return err,\n        };\n        try writer.interface.writeAll(line);\n        try writer.interface.flush();\n    }\n}\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\n    defer _ = gpa.deinit();\n\n    const rt = try zio.Runtime.init(gpa.allocator(), .{});\n    defer rt.deinit();\n\n    const addr = try zio.net.IpAddress.parseIp4(\"127.0.0.1\", 8080);\n    const server = try addr.listen(rt, .{});\n    defer server.close(rt);\n\n    std.log.info(\"Listening on {f}\", .{server.socket.address});\n\n    var group: zio.Group = .init;\n    defer group.cancel(rt);\n\n    while (true) {\n        const stream = try server.accept(rt);\n        errdefer stream.close(rt);\n\n        try group.spawn(rt, handleClient, .{ rt, stream });\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSee `examples/*.zig` and [mini-redis](https://github.com/lalinsky/zio-mini-redis) for more examples.\n\nYou can also have a look at [Dusty](https://github.com/lalinsky/dusty), a HTTP server library that uses Zio.\n\n## Building\n\n```bash\n# Build the library and examples\nzig build\n\n# Run tests\nzig build test\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the [MIT license].\n\n[MIT license]: https://github.com/lalinsky/zio/blob/main/LICENSE\n",
