As a result, we have no dependencies now.\n\nFinally, [B factory, Inc](https://www.bfactory.ai/), which is my employer and graciously agreed to release this library to the public.\n\n<br></br>\n[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=bfactory-ai/zignal&type=Date)](https://www.star-history.com/#bfactory-ai/zignal&Date)\n",

library heavily inspired by dlib.\r\nZignal is already powering virtual makeup try-on technology at [Ameli](https://ameli.co.kr/) by [B Factory Inc](https://bfactory.ai/) on the web and on Android.\r\n\r\n## Core Features\r\n\r\n### Image Processing\r\n- **Native Image Type**: Generic `Image(T)` supporting any pixel type (u8, f32, RGB, RGBA, etc.)\r\n- **Memory-Efficient Views**: Sub-images that share memory with parent images (zero-copy)\r\n- **Image I/O**: Native codecs with no external dependencies\r\n  - **PNG**: Full codec with comprehensive format support\r\n    - All PNG color types: RGB, RGBA, Grayscale, Palette\r\n    - 8-bit and 16-bit depths, interlaced images\r\n    - Transparency and gamma correction support\r\n  - **JPEG**: Decoder for most common variants\r\n    - Baseline and progressive JPEG support with chroma subsampling\r\n    - YCbCr and grayscale color spaces\r\n    - High-quality decoding with proper color space handling\r\n- **Image Transformations**: Resize, crop, rotate, flip operations\r\n- **Pixel-Level Operations**: Direct pixel manipulation with type safety\r\n\r\n### Color Science (12 Color Spaces)\r\nComprehensive color

balance](https://bfactory-ai.github.io/zignal/examples/white-balance.html)\r\n\r\n## Performance & Design\r\n\r\n### Explicit Allocation Philosophy\r\n- All operations work either in-place or can use a allocator\r\n- Minimal memory footprint for embedded applications\r\n\r\n### SIMD Acceleration\r\n- Used throughout the library: GEMM, image filtering...\r\n- Automatic detection of 4×u8 structs for SIMD optimization\r\n- Vectorized operations for RGB/RGBA pixel processing\r\n\r\n### Type Safety\r\n- Compile-time guarantees for image operations\r\n- Generic programming for pixel type flexibility\r\n- Runtime validation for color space operations\r\n\r\n## Cross-Platform Support\r\n\r\n**Tier 1 Platforms (CI Tested):**\r\n- **Linux** (x86_64, aarch64)\r\n- **mac OS** (Intel, Apple Silicon)\r\n- **Windows** (x86_64)\r\n- **WebAssembly** (all browsers)\r\n\r\n**Build System:**\r\n- Native Zig build system with cross-compilation\r\n- Python wheel building for all major platforms\r\n- Comprehensive CI/CD with automated testing\r\n\r\n## Documentation & Examples\r\n\r\n- **Comprehensive API Documentation**: Generated from source\r\n- **Interactive Examples**: 15+ examples covering all major features\r\n- **Production Use Case**: Virtual makeup try-on application\r\n- **Tutorial Content**: From basic color conversion to advanced PCA\r\n\r\n## Production Ready\r\n\r\nZignal 0.1.0 is already battle-tested in production:\r\n- **B Factory Inc**: Powers virtual makeup try-on at [Ameli](https://ameli.co.kr/)\r\n- **Performance Critical**: Real-time image processing in mobile apps\r\n- **Memory Efficient**: Designed for resource-constrained environments\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n### Zig Native\r\n```bash\r\nzig fetch --save https://github.com/bfactory-ai/zignal/archive/0.1.0.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\n```zig\r\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\r\nconst zignal = @import(\"zignal\");\r\nconst Canvas = zignal.Canvas;\r\nconst Image = zignal.Image;\r\nconst Point2d = zignal.Point2d;\r\nconst Rgba = zignal.Rgba;\r\nconst savePng = zignal.savePng;\r\n\r\npub fn main() !void {\r\n    const allocator = std.heap.page_allocator;\r\n\r\n    // Create a 800x600 RGBA image\r\n    var image: Image(Rgba) = try .initAlloc(allocator, 600, 800);\r\n    defer image.deinit(allocator);\r\n\r\n    // Create a drawing canvas\r\n    const canvas: Canvas(Rgba) = .init(allocator, image);\r\n    canvas.fill(Rgba.white);\r\n\r\n    const red: Rgba = .{ .r = 255, .g = 0, .b = 0, .a = 255 };\r\n    const start: Point2d(f32) = .init2d(50, 50);\r\n    const end: Point2d(f32) = .init2d(750, 100);\r\n    const center: Point2d(f32) = .init2d(400, 300);\r\n\r\n    canvas.drawLine(start, end, red, 5, .soft);\r\n    canvas.drawCircle(center, 100, red, 3, .soft);\r\n\r\n    // Save the result to a PNG file\r\n    try savePng(Rgba, allocator, image, \"drawing.png\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Python\r\n```bash\r\npip install zignal-processing\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport zignal\r\nrgb = zignal.Rgb(255, 128, 64)\r\nhsv = rgb.to_hsv()\r\nprint(f\"{rgb} => {hsv}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### WebAssembly\r\n```bash\r\nzig build -Dtarget=wasm32-freestanding -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Roadmap\r\n\r\n**0.2.0**\r\n- Complete Python bindings feature parity\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nZignal is released under the
