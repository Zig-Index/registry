Please check the issues to view requested features\n\n\nWhy Wyhash?\n\n- ✅ Extremely fast performance across different architectures\n- ✅ High-quality randomness and strong avalanche effect\n- ✅ Minimal code size and efficient memory usage\n- ✅ Used in databases, networking, and high-performance applications\n\n\n\n# 🛠 Basic Usage\n\n```zig\nconst wyhash = @import(\"wyhash\");\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    const r: u64 = 0x001020120;\n\n    const res = wyhash._whash(\"🔥Hello World!\", r);\n    std.debug.print(\"wyhash(\\\"🔥Hello World!\\\", {}) = {}\\n\", .{ r, res });\n}\n\n```\n\n# 📦 Installation\n\n*Add this to your build.zig.zon*\n\n```zig\n.dependencies = .{\n    .wyhash = .{\n        .url = \"https://github.com/NikoMalik/wyhash/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz\",\n        //the correct hash will be suggested by zig\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n*And add this to you build.zig*\n\n```zig\n    const wyhash = b.dependency(\"wyhash\", .{\n        .target = target,\n        .optimize = optimize,\n    });\n    exe_mod.addImport(\"wyhash\", wyhash.module(\"wyhash\"));\n\n\n```\nYou can then import the library into your code like this\n\n```zig\nconst wyhash = @import(\"wyhash\")\n```\n\n\n#  📦 Installation/2\n\n```bash\n\ngit clone https://github.com/NikoMalik/wyhash.git\nmv wyhash /path/to/your/project/directory\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n# 🔥 Benchmarks\n\nWyhash is one of the fastest hash functions available. Benchmarks against MurmurHash3, XXHash, and CityHash show superior performance in most cases.\n\n\n\n# 👥 Credits\n\nOriginal Wyhash: Wang Yi\n\nRepo: https://github.com/wangyi-fudan/wyhash\n\n\n",
