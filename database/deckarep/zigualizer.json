Additionally, I am leveraging comptime in a few spots to\ngenerate some static windowing functions.\n\n## Raylib integration\nFor a more thorough example see raylib.zig in the examples/ folder.\nIntegration is a 4-step process (aside from music stream code).\n\n```zig\n// 1. Import\nconst fft = @import(\"zigualizer\");\n\n// 2. Init\nfft.FFT_Analyzer.reset();\n\n// After loading up a Raylib Music stream.\ntrack = c.LoadMusicStream(pathToTrack);\ndefer c.UnloadMusicStream(track);\n\n// 3. Attach\nc.AttachAudioStreamProcessor(track.stream, fft.FFT_Analyzer.fft_process_callback);\nc.PlayMusicStream(track);\n\n// In your update loop\nfn update() void {\n    c.UpdateMusicStream(track);\n    // 4. Analyze\n    frames = fft.FFT_Analyzer.analyze(c.GetFrameTime());\n}\n\n// In your draw loop render the FFT however you like!\nfn draw() void {\n    c.BeginDrawing();\n    defer c.EndDrawing();\n    c.ClearBackground(c.BLACK);\n    \n    // 5. Draw\n    renderFFT(400, 200);\n}\n```\n\n## Building the examples\n```sh\n# Run the Raylib demo.\nzig build -Dexample-name=raylib.zig && zig-out/example/raylib\n```\n",
