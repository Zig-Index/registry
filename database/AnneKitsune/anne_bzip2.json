  "readme": "# Zig Bzip2\nThis is wrapper around the C bzip2 implementation, making it easier to use from zig.\n\n## Usage\nCall these two functions:\n```zig\nfn compress(allocator: std.mem.Allocator, reader: *std.Io.Reader, writer: *std.Io.Writer, options: Bzip2StreamCompressor.Options) !usize;\nfn decompress(allocator: std.mem.Allocator, reader: *std.Io.Reader, writer: *std.Io.Writer, options: Bzip2StreamDecompressor.Options) !usize;\n```\n\nThey will take data from the reader and write it to the writer after compressing/decompressing.\n\nFor a more advanced usage (I'm not sure that would be ever required), see `src/compressor.zig` and `src/decompressor.zig` code documentation.\n",
