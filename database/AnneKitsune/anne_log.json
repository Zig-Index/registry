  "readme": "# Simple zig logging library to file\n\nThis is a minimalist scoped logger. It is opiniated in design:\n1. We only support file output.\n2. We only provide `info` and `err`. Info is for general information and what would be considered \"warnings\". It is also for *recoverable* errors. Err is for errors where unexpected loss of functionality occurs.\n3. The output file is in tsv-like format. The exception is that some messages are multiline (like stacktraces for errors).\n\n### Usage\n1. Add to your build.zig.zon.\n2. Add the module to your module.\n3. Link against the library.\n4. Use the following code example as a template:\n```zig\nvar logger = try Log.init(.{});\ndefer logger.deinit();\n\nconst root_scope = logger.scope(\"root\");\nroot_scope.info(\"abc\", .{});\nroot_scope.err(\"some mean error\", .{});\n```\n\n",
