  "readme": "# Python style libraries for Zig\n\nZig as a language likes to keep things explicit (e.g. allocators). This makes transpilers more\ncomplex since one line of python explodes into many lines of zig.\n\nTry a library approach so we keep the expansion minimal\n\n## Building\n\nTo build the library, you need to have Zig installed (version 0.11.0 or later).\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/your-username/pylib-zig.git\ncd pylib-zig\n\n# Build the library\nzig build\n\n# Run tests\nzig build test\n```\n\nOr use the provided build script:\n```bash\n./build.sh\n```\n\n## CI\n\nThis project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The CI pipeline:\n- Tests building the library\n- Runs all unit tests\n- Tests against recent Zig versions (0.14.x for now)\n",
