  "readme": "# nfd-zig\n\n`nfd-zig` is a Zig binding to the library [nativefiledialog](https://github.com/mlabbe/nativefiledialog) which provides a convenient cross-platform interface to opening file dialogs on Linux, macOS and Windows.\n\nThis library has been tested on Windows 10, macOS 11.1 and Linux.\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can run a demo with `zig build run`. The demo's source is in `src/demo.zig`.\n\nIf you want to add the library to your own project...\n\n- Add the `nfd` dependency to your `build.zig.zon`\n  ```zig\n  .{\n    .dependencies = .{\n      .nfd = .{ .path = \"libs/nfd-zig\" }, // Assuming nfd-zig is available in the local directory. Use .url otherwise.\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n- Add the import in your `build.zig`:\n  ```zig\n  const nfd = b.dependency(\"nfd\", .{});\n  const nfd_mod = nfd.module(\"nfd\");\n  exe.root_module.addImport(\"nfd\", nfd_mod);\n  ```\n\n## Screenshot\n\n![Open dialog on Windows 10](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlabbe/nativefiledialog/67345b80ebb429ecc2aeda94c478b3bcc5f7888e/screens/open_win.png)\n",
