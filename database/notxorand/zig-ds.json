Most of these exist in the Rust ecosystem already (not standardised), so I'm mostly porting them over.\n\nIt's a work in progress, with plans for:\n\n- [x] bitmap\n- [x] bloom filter\n- [ ] cuckoo filter\n- [ ] merkle tree\n- [ ] merkle mountain range (mmr)\n- [ ] sparse merkle tree (smt)\n- [ ] lamport clock\n- [ ] vector clock\n\nNote: I just started writing Zig, so don't expect things to necessarily work as expected.\n",
