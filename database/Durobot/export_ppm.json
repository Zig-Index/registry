  "readme": "# export_ppm\n\nJust a couple of functions in Zig that export image data, RGB/RGBA/grayscale/grayscale+alpha (but alpha channel is ignored), 8 or 16 bits per channel, as PPM/PGM files. Not enough code to be called a library.\n\nPPM and PGM are very simple graphic file formats, but they are widespread enough for popular editors, like [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/), [Krita](https://krita.org) or [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/file-types/image/raster/ppm-file.html) to be able to open them. Meaning you can quickly dump whatever you want from your Zig programs as a PPM/PGM file and open it in an editor.\n\nSee https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm?useskin=vector, https://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppm.html.\n\nCheck out the tests in  `export_ppm.zig` for examples of use.\n\n**test_data_src** folder contains PNG images I used as test data, ignore them or use them however you want. I release them in public domain.\n\n**export_ppm.zig** is licensed under [the MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MIT_License&useskin=vector).\n\nJust drop `export_ppm.zig` into your project and add `const eppm = @import(\"export_ppm.zig\");`, or use the Zig package manager:\n\n1. In your project's `build.zig.zon`, in `.dependencies`, add\n\n   ```zig\n   .export_ppm =\n   .{\n       .url = \"https://github.com/Durobot/export_ppm/archive/<GIT COMMIT HASH, 40 HEX DIGITS>.tar.gz\",\n       .hash = \"<ZIG PACKAGE HASH, 68 HEX DIGITS>\" // Use arbitrary hash, get correct hash from the error \n   }\n   ```\n\n2. In your project's `build.zig`, in `pub fn build`, before `b.installArtifact(exe);`, add\n\n   ```zig\n   const eppm = b.dependency(\"export_ppm\",\n   .{\n       .target = target,\n       .optimize = optimize,\n   });\n   exe.root_module.addImport(\"export_ppm\", eppm.module(\"export_ppm\"));\n   ```\n\n3. Add `const eppm = @import(\"export_ppm\");`in your source file(s).\n\n4. Build your project with `zig build`, as you normally do.",
