  "readme": "zigStructPrint\n\nSmall library to pretty-print Zig structs (and arrays)\n\n**zigStructPrint** is licensed under under [the MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MIT_License&useskin=vector) and available from https://github.com/Durobot/zigStructPrint\n\nPlease note that only Zig **0.14.0-dev.1421+f87dd43c1** (give or take) and up is supported because of [this breaking change](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/commit/0fe3fd01ddc2cd49c6a2b939577d16b9d2c65ea9) in the Zig standard library. If you need zigStructPrint for an earlier version of Zig, get [this version](https://github.com/Durobot/zigStructPrint/releases/tag/v0.1-beta) instead.\n\nTo use, either drop [zsp.zig](https://github.com/Durobot/zigStructPrint/blob/main/src/zsp.zig) into your project, or, if you prefer Zig package manager:\n\n1. In `build.zig.zon`, in `.dependencies`, add\n\n   ```zig\n   .zigStructPrint =\n   .{\n       .url = \"https://github.com/Durobot/zigStructPrint/archive/<COMMIT HASH, 40 HEX DIGITS>.tar.gz\",\n       .hash = \"<ZIG PACKAGE HASH, 68 HEX DIGITS>\" // Use arbitrary hash, get correct hash from the error \n   }\n   ```\n\n2. In `build.zig`, in `pub fn build`, before `b.installArtifact(exe);`, add\n\n   ```zig\n   const zsp = b.dependency(\"zigStructPrint\",\n   .{\n       .target = target,\n       .optimize = optimize,\n   });\n   exe.root_module.addImport(\"zigStructPrint\", zsp.module(\"zigStructPrint\"));\n   ```\n\nBuild with `zig build`, as you normally do.\n\nActually printing out your struct:\n\n```zig\nconst zsp = @import(\"zigStructPrint\");\n. . .\nconst MyStruct = struct\n{\n    a: i8 = -10,\n    b: u32 = 10,\n    c: [3]u8 = [_]u8 { 1, 2, 3 },\n    d: [2]Nested = .{ .{ .f = 10.0, .g = \"Hello\" }, .{ .f = -20.0, .g = \"Bye\" }, },\n    e: [3]Color = .{ .red, .green, .yellow },\n\n    const Nested = struct { f: f32, g: []const u8 };\n    const Color = enum { red, yellow, green };\n};\nconst ms = MyStruct {};\nzsp.printStruct(ms, true, 0); // try `false` to get full type names\n```\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n```zig\n{\n    a: i8 = -10\n    b: u32 = 10\n    c: [3]u8 = [ 1, 2, 3, ]\n    d: [2]Nested = [ { f: f32 = 10, g: []const u8 = \"Hello\", }, { f: f32 = -20, g: []const u8 = \"Bye\", }, ]\n    e: [3]Color = [ red, green, yellow, ]\n}\n```",

Get the latest version instead.",
