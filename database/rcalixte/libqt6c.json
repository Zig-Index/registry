You must have a working C and C++ development toolchain to use this binding as well as the development files needed to build Qt 6 applications. This library and the related examples use the Zig toolchain. The [Building](#building) section below has instructions for installing the required dependencies.\n\nFor previous libqt6c versions supporting Qt 6.4+, there are branches corresponding to the major and minor version of the Qt base, e.g. `6.4`. Note that these versions will receive minimal support and should be considered frozen.\n\nThis library is designed to be used as a dependency in a larger application and not as a standalone library. The versioning scheme used by this library is based on the Qt version used as a base to generate the bindings with an additional nod to the library revision number. Any breaking changes to the library will be reflected in the changelog.\n\nThese bindings are based on the [MIQT bindings for Go](https://github.com/mappu/miqt) that were released in August 2024. This library features support for Qt Core, GUI, Widgets, and Network as well as [additional Qt modules](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qt-additional-modules.html) such as Multimedia, Print Support, Spatial Audio, SQL, SVG, WebChannel, WebEngine, and more. In addition to Qt modules, this library also features support for third-party libraries such as [QCustomPlot](https://www.qcustomplot.com), [QScintilla](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/qscintilla), various [KDE Frameworks](https://develop.kde.org/products/frameworks/), and others. This library has support for slots/signals, subclassing, custom widgets, async via Qt, etc. In addition, there is library tooling that provides native support for Qt Creator/Designer forms and the Qt Resource System. With improper handling, it is fairly easy to encounter segmentation faults or errors. Q3 of the [FAQ](#faq) is a decent entry point for newcomers in addition to the [examples](https://github.com/rcalixte/libqt6c-examples) and the [demo application](https://github.com/rcalixte/libqt6c-demo). Please try out the library and start a [discussion](https://github.com/rcalixte/libqt6c/discussions) if you have any questions or issues directly relevant to this library.\n\n---\n\n### TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n- [Supported platforms](#supported-platforms)\n- [License](#license)\n- [Examples](#examples)\n- [Building](#building)\n  - [FreeBSD (native)](#freebsd-native)\n  - [Linux (native)](#linux-native)\n    - [Debian-based distributions](#debian-based-distributions)\n    - [Fedora-based distributions](#fedora-based-distributions)\n    - [Arch-based distributions](#arch-based-distributions)\n  - [macOS (native)](#macos-native)\n  - [Windows (native)](#windows-native)\n- [Tools](#tools)\n  - [FreeBSD](#freebsd)\n  - [Linux](#linux)\n    - [Debian-based](#debian-based)\n    - [Fedora-based](#fedora-based)\n    - [Arch-based](#arch-based)\n  - [macOS](#macos)\n  - [Windows](#windows)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [FAQ](#faq)\n  - [Q1.

For less-permissive licenses, these restrictions are documented in the library's README file. The prefix paths for the subdirectory for these libraries are documented below.\n\n| Prefix             | Operating System Support  | Licensing   |\n| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------- |\n| extras-            | all platforms<sup>1</sup> | Permissive  |\n| foss-extras-       | BSD & Linux only          | Permissive  |\n| foss-restricted-   | BSD & Linux only          | Restrictive |\n| posix-extras-      | non-Windows               | Permissive  |\n| posix-restricted-  | non-Windows               | Restrictive |\n| restricted-extras- | all platforms             | Restrictive |\n\n<sup>1</sup>While macOS and Windows are supported upstream by the libraries, library installation for these platforms may be non-trivial. Therefore, these libraries are disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled with the appropriate build option.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThe `libqt6c` bindings are licensed under the MIT license.\n\nYou must also meet your license obligations for Qt and the included libraries.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nThe [`helloworld`](https://github.com/rcalixte/libqt6c-examples/tree/master/src/helloworld/main.c) example follows:\n\n```c\n#include <libqt6c.h>\n\n#define BUFFER_SIZE 64\n\nstatic long counter = 0;\n\nvoid button_callback(void* self) {\n    counter++;\n    char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];\n    snprintf(buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, \"You have clicked the button %ld time(s)\", counter);\n    q_pushbutton_set_text(self, buffer);\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char* argv[]) {\n    // Initialize Qt application\n    QApplication* qapp = q_application_new(&argc, argv);\n\n    QWidget* widget = q_widget_new2();\n    if (!widget) {\n        // we can use assert or check for null to simulate exception handling\n        // assert(widget != NULL);\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Failed to create widget\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // We don't need to free the button, it's a child of the widget\n    QPushButton* button = q_pushbutton_new5(\"Hello world!\", widget);\n    if (!button) {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Failed to create button\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    q_pushbutton_set_fixed_width(button, 320);\n    q_pushbutton_on_clicked(button, button_callback);\n    q_widget_show(widget);\n\n    int result = q_application_exec();\n\n    q_widget_delete(widget);\n    q_application_delete(qapp);\n\n    printf(\"OK!\\n\");\n\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nFull examples are available in the [`libqt6c-examples`](https://github.com/rcalixte/libqt6c-examples) repository.\n\nBuilding\n--------\n\nOnce the required packages are installed, the library can be built from the root of the repository:\n\n```bash\nzig build\n```\n\nUsers of Arch-based distributions need to __make sure that all packages are up-to-date__ first and will need to add the following option to support successful compilation:\n\n```bash\nzig build -Denable-workaround\n```\n\nThe compiled libraries can be installed to the system in a non-default location by adding the `--prefix-lib-dir` option to the build command:\n\n```bash\nsudo zig build --prefix-lib-dir /usr/local/lib/libqt6c # creates /usr/local/lib/libqt6c/{libraries}\n```\n\nPrefixed libraries have per-library options that can be used to enable or disable them (where supported):\n\n```bash\nzig build -Denable-charts=true -Denable-qscintilla=false\n```\n\nIn the event that one or more extra library include paths are needed e.g. a locally compiled extra library in a non-standard path, the `extra-paths` option supports this use case:\n\n```bash\nzig build -Dextra-paths=\"C:/Qt/6/llvm-mingw_64\"\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\nzig build -Dextra-paths={\"/opt/qt6\",\"/opt/lib/qt6\"}\n```\n\nTo see the full list of build options available:\n\n```bash\nzig build --help\n```\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Cross-compilation is not supported by this library at this time.\n\nThe following are instructions for building this __full__ library and the examples associated with this library. Only maintainers are suggested to directly build the full library. Where system libraries are not required or used, the installation of the libraries is optional.\n\n---\n\n### FreeBSD (native)\n\nFor dynamic linking with the Qt 6 system libraries:\n\n```bash\nsudo pkg install llvm qt6-base qt6-charts qt6-multimedia qt6-pdf qt6-positioning qt6-svg qt6-webchannel qt6-webengine qt6-tools kColorPicker-qt6 kf6-attica kf6-karchive kf6-kbookmarks kf6-kcodecs kf6-kcolorscheme kf6-kcompletion kf6-kconfig kf6-kconfigwidgets kf6-kcoreaddons kf6-kcrash kf6-kglobalaccel kf6-kguiaddons kf6-ki18n kf6-kiconthemes kf6-kidletime kf6-kio kf6-kitemmodels kf6-kitemviews kf6-kjobwidgets kf6-knewstuff kf6-knotifications kf6-kparts kf6-kplotting kf6-kservice kf6-solid kf6-sonnet kf6-ksvg kf6-syntax-highlighting kf6-ktexteditor kf6-ktextwidgets kf6-kwidgetsaddons kf6-kwindowsystem kf6-kxmlgui kImageAnnotator-qt6 libaccounts-qt6 plasma6-layer-shell-qt qcustomplot-qt6 qscintilla2-qt6 qtermwidget qtkeychain-qt6 PackageKit-Qt6 signon-qt6\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The `zig` package will need to be downloaded and installed separately if the latest stable version is not available in the default repositories.\n\n---\n\n### Linux (native)\n\nFor dynamic linking with the Qt 6 system libraries:\n\n#### Debian-based distributions\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install clang-format qt6-base-dev qt6-base-private-dev qt6-charts-dev qt6-multimedia-dev qt6-pdf-dev qt6-positioning-dev qt6-svg-dev qt6-webchannel-dev qt6-webengine-dev qt6-tools-dev libaccounts-qt6-dev libkcolorpicker-qt6-dev libkf6archive-dev libkf6attica-dev libkf6bookmarks-dev libkf6codecs-dev libkf6colorscheme-dev libkf6completion-dev libkf6config-dev libkf6configwidgets-dev libkf6coreaddons-dev libkf6crash-dev libkf6globalaccel-dev libkf6guiaddons-dev libkf6i18n-dev libkf6iconthemes-dev libkf6idletime-dev libkf6kio-dev libkf6itemmodels-dev libkf6itemviews-dev libkf6jobwidgets-dev libkf6newstuff-dev libkf6notifications-dev libkf6parts-dev libkf6plotting-dev libkf6service-dev libkf6solid-dev libkf6sonnet-dev libkf6svg-dev libkf6syntaxhighlighting-dev libkf6texteditor-dev libkf6textwidgets-dev libkf6widgetsaddons-dev libkf6windowsystem-dev libkf6xmlgui-dev libkimageannotator-qt6-dev liblayershellqtinterface-dev libpackagekitqt6-dev libqcustomplot-dev libqscintilla2-qt6-dev libqtermwidget-dev libsignon-qt6-dev qtkeychain-qt6-dev sonnet6-plugins\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The `zig` package must be downloaded and installed separately.\n\n#### Fedora-based distributions\n\n```bash\nsudo dnf install clang-tools-extra qt6-qtbase-devel qt6-qtcharts-devel qt6-qtmultimedia-devel qt6-qtpdf-devel qt6-qtpositioning-devel qt6-qtsvg-devel qt6-qttools-devel qt6-qtwebchannel-devel qt6-qtwebengine-devel kcolorpicker-qt6-devel kf6-attica-devel kf6-karchive-devel kf6-kbookmarks-devel kf6-kcodecs-devel kf6-kcolorscheme-devel kf6-kcompletion-devel kf6-kconfig-devel kf6-kconfigwidgets-devel kf6-kcoreaddons-devel kf6-kcrash-devel kf6-kglobalaccel-devel kf6-kguiaddons-devel kf6-ki18n-devel kf6-kiconthemes-devel kf6-kidletime-devel kf6-kio-devel kf6-kitemmodels-devel kf6-kitemviews-devel kf6-kjobwidgets-devel kf6-knewstuff-devel kf6-knotifications-devel kf6-kparts-devel kf6-kplotting-devel kf6-kservice-devel kf6-ksvg-devel kf6-ktexteditor-devel kf6-ktextwidgets-devel kf6-kwidgetsaddons-devel kf6-kwindowsystem-devel kf6-kxmlgui-devel kf6-solid-devel kf6-sonnet-devel kf6-syntax-highlighting-devel kimageannotator-qt6-devel layer-shell-qt-devel libaccounts-qt6-devel qcustomplot-qt6-devel qscintilla-qt6-devel qtermwidget-devel qtkeychain-qt6-devel kf6-sonnet-aspell PackageKit-Qt6-devel signon-qt6-devel\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The `zig` package will need to be downloaded and installed separately if the latest stable version is not available in the default repositories.\n\n#### Arch-based distributions\n\n```bash\nsudo pacman -S clang qt6-base qt6-charts qt6-multimedia qt6-positioning qt6-svg qt6-webchannel qt6-webengine qt6-tools attica karchive kbookmarks kcodecs kcolorpicker kcolorscheme kcompletion kconfig kconfigwidgets kcoreaddons kcrash kglobalaccel kguiaddons ki18n kiconthemes kidletime kimageannotator kio kitemmodels kitemviews kjobwidgets knewstuff knotifications kparts kplotting kservice ksvg ktexteditor ktextwidgets kwidgetsaddons kwindowsystem kxmlgui layer-shell-qt libaccounts-qt packagekit-qt6 qcustomplot-qt6 qscintilla-qt6 qtermwidget qtkeychain-qt6 signond solid sonnet syntax-highlighting\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The `zig` package will need to be downloaded and installed separately if the latest stable version is not available in the default repositories.\n\n---\n\n### macOS (native)\n\nFor macOS, currently the Qt 6 framework and QScintilla are available via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).\n\n```bash\nbrew install qt6 qscintilla2\n```\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> In recent versions of Qt 6, the symlinks are not correctly created at the time of installation and must be created manually for each framework.

The tools are not required for the library to function but are recommended for convenience to augment the tooling provided by Qt.\n\nThe custom implementation of Qt's `lupdate` allows for the generation of translation source files directly from C code. There are also custom implementations of Qt's `uic` and `rcc` tools to allow using Qt Creator or Qt Designer for form design and resource management. There is full support for the additional widgets provided by the KDE Frameworks in the design mode, enabled via command-line flags. The programs and their respective documentation are located at the links above.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Only Qt Creator 16.0 (or higher) and Qt Designer 6.8.2 (or higher) are supported for use with these tools. Any existing `.ui` or `.qrc` files should be saved/exported from one of them to ensure proper execution with the custom tooling. Older versions can result in panics and are not supported.\n\nWhile optional for the `lupdate-c` and `uic-c` programs, there is a hard system dependency for the `qrc-c` program on the `rcc` tool provided by Qt.\n\nIn addition to the library tooling above, there are bindings for Qt Designer and Qt UI Tools that support run-time loading of forms for widget construction. Refer to the [designer](https://github.com/rcalixte/libqt6c-examples/tree/master/src/libraries/designer) and [uitools](https://github.com/rcalixte/libqt6c-examples/tree/master/src/libraries/uitools) examples for sample usage.\n\n---\n\n### FreeBSD\n\n```bash\nsudo pkg install qt6-tools\n```\n\nOnce installed, the `lrelease` and `lupdate` tools are located at:\n\n- `/usr/local/lib/qt6/bin/lrelease`\n- `/usr/local/lib/qt6/bin/lupdate`\n\nThe `rcc` and `uic` tools are already installed with `qt6-base` and located at:\n\n- `/usr/local/libexec/qt6/rcc`\n- `/usr/local/libexec/qt6/uic`\n\n---\n\n### Linux\n\n#### Debian-based\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install qt6-base-dev-tools qt6-l10n-tools\n```\n\nOnce installed, the tools are located at:\n\n- `/usr/lib/qt6/bin/lrelease`\n- `/usr/lib/qt6/bin/lupdate`\n- `/usr/lib/qt6/libexec/rcc`\n- `/usr/lib/qt6/libexec/uic`\n\n#### Fedora-based\n\n```bash\nsudo dnf install qt6-linguist\n```\n\nOnce installed, the `lrelease` and `lupdate` tools are located at:\n\n- `/usr/lib64/qt6/bin/lrelease`\n- `/usr/lib64/qt6/bin/lupdate`\n\nThe `rcc` and `uic` tools are already installed with `qt6-qtbase-devel` and located at:\n\n- `/usr/lib64/qt6/libexec/rcc`\n- `/usr/lib64/qt6/libexec/uic`\n\n#### Arch-based\n\n```bash\nsudo pacman -S qt6-tools\n```\n\nOnce installed, the `lrelease` and `lupdate` tools are located at:\n\n- `/usr/lib/qt6/bin/lrelease`\n- `/usr/lib/qt6/bin/lupdate`\n\nThe `rcc` and `uic` tools are already installed with `qt6-base` and located at:\n\n- `/usr/lib/qt6/rcc`\n- `/usr/lib/qt6/uic`\n\n---\n\n### macOS\n\nIf Qt 6 is installed via Homebrew, the tools are already installed and located at:\n\n- `/opt/homebrew/bin/lrelease`\n- `/opt/homebrew/bin/lupdate`\n- `/opt/homebrew/share/qt/libexec/rcc`\n- `/opt/homebrew/share/qt/libexec/uic`\n\nIf Qt 6 is installed via the official installer, the tools are already installed and located in a subdirectory of the Qt installation path similar to the paths above.\n\n---\n\n### Windows\n\nIf Qt 6 is installed via the official installer, the tools are already installed and located at:\n\n- `C:\\Qt\\6.8.3\\llvm-mingw_64\\bin\\lrelease.exe`\n- `C:\\Qt\\6.8.3\\llvm-mingw_64\\bin\\lupdate.exe`\n- `C:\\Qt\\6.8.3\\llvm-mingw_64\\bin\\rcc.exe`\n- `C:\\Qt\\6.8.3\\llvm-mingw_64\\bin\\uic.exe`\n\nThe version of the Qt 6 installation path may differ depending on the version of Qt that is installed.\n\n---\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n- If using Zig's build system, use a commit hash to import the library into your project:\n\n```bash\nzig fetch --save https://github.com/rcalixte/libqt6c/archive/<commit>.tar.gz\n```\n\nAlternative file formats exist as well, such as:\n\n```bash\nzig fetch --save https://github.com/rcalixte/libqt6c/archive/<commit>.zip\n```\n\n- Add the library to your `build.zig` file:\n\n```zig\nconst qt6c = b.dependency(\"libqt6c\", .{\n    .target = target,\n    .optimize = .ReleaseFast,\n});\n\n// After defining the executable, add the include path from the library\nexe.root_module.addIncludePath(qt6c.path(\"include\"));\n\n// Link the compiled libqt6c libraries to the executable\n// qt_lib_name is the name of the target library without prefix and suffix, e.g. qapplication, qwidget, etc.\nexe.root_module.linkLibrary(qt6c.artifact(qt_lib_name));\n```\n\n__Extra options are required for building on Arch-based distributions.

Can I release a proprietary, commercial app with this binding?\n\nYes. You must also meet your Qt license obligations: either dynamically link Qt library files under the LGPL or purchase a Qt commercial license for static linking.\n\n### Q2. How long does it take to compile?\n\nUnder normal conditions, the first compilation of the entire library should take less than 30 minutes, assuming the hardware in use is at or above the level of that of a consumer-grade mid-tier machine released in the past decade. Once the build cache is warmed up, subsequent compilations should be very fast, on the order of seconds. __Compiling the entire library is not necessary unless direct library development is an objective.__ For client applications that use and configure a specific subset of the main library, the expected compilation time should be much shorter, e.g. compiling the `helloworld` example, only linking the libraries needed and without a warm cache, should take under 30 seconds. This assumes the Zig build system is being used.\n\n### Q3. How does the `libqt6c` API differ from the official Qt C++ API?\n\nSupported Qt C++ class methods are implemented 1:1 as C functions where the function names in C correspond to the snake_case equivalent of the combined Qt C++ class and method names, with the `Q` prefix altered to `q_`. [The official Qt documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/classes.html) should be used for reference and is included in the library wrapper header code (though not all links are guaranteed to work perfectly, nor is this functionality in scope for this project). Some of the main concepts are described below with a table of code equivalents following for reference.\n\n- `QWidget::show()` is projected as `q_widget_show(void*)`\n- `QPushButton::setText(QString)` is projected as `q_pushbutton_set_text(void*, const char*)`\n\nAs a mental model, developers consuming this library should keep in mind that there are essentially two different tracks of memory management required for clean operation: one for the C++ side and one for the C side. The C side is managed by the developer and the C++ side has variant ownership semantics. Ownership semantics are documented throughout the [C++ documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/topics-core.html).\n\nThe library tries to adhere to idiomatic C where possible but is still bound by the complexity of the Qt C++ API. Knowledge of the Qt C++ API is required to understand and make full use of the library. While not an exhaustive list, there are some key topics to understand:\n\n- [Qt object ownership](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/objecttrees.html)\n- [Qt signals and slots](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/signalsandslots.html)\n- [Qt's property system](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/properties.html)\n- [Qt's Meta-Object system](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/metaobjects.html)\n- [Qt widgets](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/examples-widgets.html)\n\nThe `QByteArray` and `QString` types are projected as plain C types available within the standard library: `char*` and `const char*`. The `QList<T>` and `QVector<T>` types are projected as `T**` or `T*[]` when used as an input parameter and supported by the helper library as `libqt_list<T>` when used as a return type. The `QMap<K,V>` and `QHash<K,V>` types are supported by the helper library as `libqt_map<K,V>` but are limited beyond basic capacities with no goal of feature expansion beyond the functionality required for adequate operation in the library. Consumers of this library are free to use types from other libraries as well, especially for hash types. The [included helper library](https://github.com/rcalixte/libqt6c/blob/master/include/qtlibc.h) is not meant to be robust but to provide containers and functions for porting the Qt C++ API to a consumable C ABI API, however there are convenience macros and functions available for use. By default, this library does not expose the raw C ABI bindings and instead only makes the wrapper constructs and C ABI pointer types for the Qt C++ API available. Therefore, it is not possible call the raw C ABI or any of the Qt type's methods and some C equivalent method from the wrappers must be used instead. This library was constructed with the goal of enabling single-language application development. Anything beyond that boundary is up to the developer to implement.\n\n- C string types are internally converted to `QString` using `QString::fromUtf8`. Therefore, the C string input must be UTF-8 to avoid [mojibake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake). If the C input string contains binary data, the conversion would corrupt such bytes into U+FFFD (�). On return to C space, this becomes `\\xEF\\xBF\\xBD`.\n\n- The `libqt6c` library does not extend the C standard library and therefore it is up to the developer to provide their own functions for complex types like `QMap` and `QHash` beyond the scope of the helper library's containers.\n\nWhere Qt returns a C++ object by value (e.g. `QSize`), the binding may have moved it to the heap, and in C, this may be represented as a pointer type. In such cases, the caller is the owner and must free the object (using either `_delete` methods for the type or deallocation with `free`, `libqt_string_free`, etc.). This means code using `libqt6c` can look similar to the Qt C++ equivalent code but with the addition of proper memory management.\n\nThe `connect(targetObject, SIGNAL(signal()), targetSlot, SLOT(slot()))` methods are projected as `_on_signal(targetObject, slot)`. While the parameters in the methods themselves are more convenient to use, the documentation comments in the C header code should be used for reference for the proper usage of the parameter types and Qt vtable references. The example code above includes a simple callback function that can be used as a reference.\n\n- You can also override virtual methods like `paint_event` in the same way. Where supported, there are additional `_on_` and `_qbase_` variants:\n  - `on_paint_event`: Set an override callback function to be called when `paint_event` is invoked. For certain methods, even with the override set, the base class implementation can still be called by Qt internally and these calls can not be prevented.\n  - `qbase_paint_event`: Invoke the base class implementation of `paint_event`. This is useful for when the custom implementation requires the base class implementation. (When there is no override set, the `qbase_paint_event` implementation is equivalent to `paint_event`.)\n\nDue to current limitations, QPainter does not reliably initialize within paint event callbacks, even when using manual `begin()` and `end()` calls. The result is warnings such as \"A paint device can only be painted by one painter at a time\" and \"Painter not active.\" As a workaround, use QStylePainter instead for painting operations. QStylePainter inherits from QPainter, meaning that it provides access to the same drawing methods (`drawRect`, `drawLine`, `setBrush`, etc.), but it properly handles the painting context that fails to be managed with the standard QPainter. This is not Qt's official recommendation, but for practical purposes, when using this library, use QStylePainter as your standard painter class for paint event implementations.\n\nQt class inherited types are projected via void pointers and type casting in C. For example, to pass a `QLabel* myLabel` to a function taking only the `QWidget*` base class, it should be sufficient to pass `myLabel` and the library will automatically cast it to the correct type and Qt vtable reference.\n\n- When a Qt subclass adds a method overload (e.g. `QMenu::sizeHint(QMenu*)` vs `QWidget::sizeHint(QWidget*)`), the base class version is shadowed and can only be called via `q_widget_size_hint(void*)` while the subclass implementation can be called directly, e.g. `q_menu_size_hint(void*)`. Inherited methods are shadowed for convenience as well, e.g. `q_menu_show(void*)` is equivalent to `q_widget_show(void*)`. While the library aims to simplify usage, consideration should still be given to the Qt documentation for the proper usage of the parameter types and Qt vtable references.\n\nQt expects fixed OS threads to be used for each QObject. When you first call `q_application_new`, that will be considered the [Qt main thread](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.8/thread-basics.html#gui-thread-and-worker-thread).\n\n- When accessing Qt objects from inside another thread, it's safest to use `q_threading_async` to access the Qt objects from Qt's main thread. The [Threading library](https://github.com/rcalixte/libqt6c/tree/master/src/threading/libqt6cthreading.h) documents additional available strategies within the header code.\n\nQt C++ enums are projected as PascalCase C typedef enums, replacing namespace indicators from C++ (`::`) with underscores and where the C enum values are represented by the uppercase equivalent of the Qt C++ class name, enum name, and enum value, with casing exceptions for the values for `Qt::Key` and `QsciLexerRuby::PercentString*`. For example, `Qt::AlignmentFlag` is projected as a C enum typedef of `Qt__AlignmentFlag` with values prefixed by `QT_ALIGNMENTFLAG`. Enum values are typed in their definitions as `int8_t`, `int32_t`, `int64_t`, `uint8_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t`, or `uint64_t` by the C API when expected as a parameter or returned as a type. Qt C++ [QFlags](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qflags.html) are projected as `int32_t`, `uint8_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t` where possible when expected as a parameter or returned as a type by the C API or `int64_t` due to their bitmask usage and the potential to overflow.\n\n#### API at a glance\n\n##### Objects\n\n```cpp\n// Qt 6 C++ API\nQWidget* widget = new QWidget();\nwidget->setWindowTitle(\"Hello world!\");\nwidget->show();\n\ndelete widget;\n```\n\n```c\n// libqt6c API\nQWidget* widget = q_widget_new2();\nq_widget_set_window_title(widget, \"Hello world!\");\nq_widget_show(widget);\n\nq_widget_delete(widget);\n```\n\n##### Signals/slots\n\n```cpp\n// Qt 6 C++ API\nconnect(widget, &QWidget::customEvent, this, &MyClass::onCustomEvent);\n```\n\n```c\n// libqt6c API\nq_widget_on_custom_event(widget, on_custom_event);\n```\n\n##### Enums\n\n```cpp\n// Qt 6 C++ API\nQt::AlignmentFlag alignment = Qt::AlignmentFlag::AlignLeft | Qt::AlignmentFlag::AlignTop;\n```\n\n```c\n// libqt6c API\nint32_t alignment = QT_ALIGNMENTFLAG_ALIGNLEFT | QT_ALIGNMENTFLAG_ALIGNTOP;\n```\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Some C++ idioms that were difficult to project were omitted from the binding. This can be improved in the future.\n\n### Q4. What build modes are supported by the library's build system?\n\nCurrently, only `ReleaseFast`, `ReleaseSafe`, and `ReleaseSmall` are supported. The `Debug` build mode is not supported. This may change in the future. The default build mode is `ReleaseFast`. To change the build mode:\n\n```bash\nzig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\nzig build --release=safe\n```\n\n### Q5. Can I use another build system?\n\nIn theory, any build system that supports both C and C++ should work. However, this has only been lightly tested and is therefore unsupported and left as an exercise for the interested reader.\n\n### Q6. How can I add bindings for another Qt library?\n\nFork this repository and add your library to the `genbindings/config-libraries` file.
