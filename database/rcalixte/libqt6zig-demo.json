For the demo application, the following commands can be used to create the symlinks:\n>\n> ```bash\n> ln -s /opt/homebrew/lib/QtCore.framework/Headers /opt/homebrew/include/QtCore\n> ln -s /opt/homebrew/lib/QtGui.framework/Headers /opt/homebrew/include/QtGui\n> ln -s /opt/homebrew/lib/QtWidgets.framework/Headers /opt/homebrew/include/QtWidgets\n> ```\n\nThe official Qt installer is also supported but will require manually creating the symlinks as above and using the `extra-paths` option described below, using the root of the include directory as the path value.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The `zig` package will need to be downloaded and installed separately if the latest stable version is not available via Homebrew.\n\n---\n\n### Windows (native)\n\nFor Windows, use the official Qt installer and install a Qt version built with LLVM-MinGW.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The `zig` package will need to be downloaded and installed separately.\n\n---\n\nOnce the required packages are installed, the demo application can be built from the root of the repository:\n\n```bash\nzig build\n```\n\nTo build and run the demo application:\n\n```bash\nzig build run\n```\n\nIn the event that another system library path is needed e.g. a different Qt installation path, the `extra-paths` option supports this use case:\n\n```bash\nzig build -Dextra-paths=\"C:/Qt/6/llvm-mingw_64\"\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\nzig build -Dextra-paths={\"/opt/qt6\",\"/opt/lib/qt6\"}\n```\n\nFor Windows hosts, there is an additional option to specify the Qt installation directory. This is only required if passing in an alternate extra library path meant to override the default Qt library path:\n\n```bash\nzig build -Dextra-paths=\"C:/Qt/6/llvm-mingw_64\" -DQTDIR=\"C:/Qt/6/llvm-mingw_64\"\n```\n\nThe demo application can be installed to the system in a non-default location by adding the `--prefix-exe-dir` option to the build command:\n\n```bash\nsudo zig build --prefix-exe-dir /usr/local/bin # creates /usr/local/bin/mdoutliner\n```\n\nThe source code for the demo application can be found in the `src` directory of the repository.\n\nScreenshots\n-----------\n\n<table align=\"center\">\n\n|     ![cachy_kde](assets/cachy_kde.png)     |\n| :----------------------------------------: |\n|               CachyOS + KDE                |\n|    ![fedora_kde](assets/fedora_kde.png)    |\n|                Fedora + KDE                |\n|  ![freebsd_xfce](assets/freebsd_xfce.png)  |\n|               FreeBSD + Xfce               |\n| ![mint_cinnamon](assets/mint_cinnamon.png) |\n|           Linux Mint + Cinnamon            |\n|         ![macos](assets/macos.png)         |\n|                   macOS                    |\n|       ![windows](assets/windows.png)       |\n|                  Windows                   |\n\n</table>\n\nFAQ\n---\n\n### Q1. How long does it take to compile the demo application?\n\nThe first compilation should take less than a minute, far less on more recent or capable hardware.\n\n### Q2. What build modes are supported by the demo application?\n\nCurrently, only `ReleaseFast`, `ReleaseSafe`, and `ReleaseSmall` are supported. The `Debug` build mode is not supported. This may change in the future. The default build mode is `ReleaseFast`. To change the build mode:\n\n```bash\nzig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\nzig build --release=small\n```\n\nSpecial Thanks\n--------------\n\n- [@mappu](https://github.com/mappu) for the [MIQT](https://github.com/mappu/miqt) bindings that provided the phenomenal foundation for this project\n\n- [@arnetheduck](https://github.com/arnetheduck) for proving the value of collaboration on the back-end of the library while working across different target languages\n",
