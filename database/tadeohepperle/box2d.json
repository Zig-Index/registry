  "readme": "# Box2D\n\nThis is the [Box2D](https://box2d.org/) physics engine (v3) packaged for the Zig build system.\n\nThis aims to be the \"easiest to use\" Box2D wrapper for Zig.\n\nIt reexports all c functions and struct definitions but also provides a ziggified API including:\n\n- Handle types are opaque enums (`enum(u64){ _ }`) instead of structs to be easily comparable. See `World`, `Body`, `Shape`, `Chain`, `Joint`.\n- Methods on the handle types for convenience. So you can do `World.create(&WorldDef.default()` instead of `b2CreateWorld(&b2DefaultWorldDef())`.\n- Enums for `BodyType`, `ShapeType`, `JointType`.\n- Distinct handle types for `Joints` to increase type safety: `DistanceJoint`, `FilterJoint`, `MotorJoint`, `MouseJoint`, `PrismaticJoint`, `WeldJoint`, `WheelJoint`. All of them are just a `Joint` in box2d, but by making them distinct types we can provide different methods on all of them. You can convert any of them into a `Joint` by calling the `joint()` method on it, e.g to access methods available to all Joint types.\n- I manually converted `[*c]T` to either `*T`, `[*]T`, or `[*:0]u8` depdending on the context to make the API more clear for zig users.\n- Removed the `b2` prefix from a lot of struct types. If you see types or functions starting with `b2` I have not gone over this part of the API yet. You can just use them, but they don't have a \"nice\" Zig interface yet.\n\nShout out to https://github.com/allyourcodebase/box2d for helping me get started with the bindings. But using it made the compile times too slow because it kept fetching data from the original Box2d repo. So instead I just copied the `box2d/include` and `box2d/src` directories directly into this repo. This keeps it all very lightweight and we don't have any dependencies.\n\nThis also means there is currently not samples application, sorry! Make your own.\n\n## Usage\n\nAdd the dependency to your build.zig.zon:\n\n```shell\nzig fetch --save git+https://github.com/tadeohepperle/box2d#main\n```\n\nUse the dependency in your build.zig:\n\n```zig\npub fn build(b: *std.Build) void {\n    const target = b.standardTargetOptions(.{});\n    const optimize = b.standardOptimizeOption(.{});\n\n    // define your game module and executable:\n    const game_mod = b.createModule(.{\n        .root_source_file = b.path(\"src/main.zig\"),\n        .target = target,\n        .optimize = optimize,\n    });\n    const game_exe = b.addExecutable(.{\n        .name = \"game\",\n        .root_module = game_mod,\n    });\n\n    // add box2d as a dependency and add to the imports of the game module:\n    const box2d = b.dependency(\"box2d\", .{\n        .target = target,\n        .optimize = optimize,\n    });\n    game_mod.addImport(\"box2d\", box2d.module(\"box2d\"));\n}\n```\n\nImport and use the module:\n\n```zig\nconst box2d = @import(box2d);\npub fn main() void {\n    const w = box2d.World.create(&box2d.WorldDef.default());\n    std.debug.print(\"World Counters: {}\\n\", .{w.getCounters()});\n}\n```\n\n## Todo\n\n- `b2DynamicTree` is not converted yet.\n- it would be nice to let the user inject their own `Vec2` types to have less friction when interacting with the API. Have not figured out yet what's the best way to do this.\n",
