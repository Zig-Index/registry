Support for vt features is detected through\nterminal queries.\n\nVaxis uses zig `0.15.1`.\n\n## Features\n\nlibvaxis supports all major platforms: macOS, Windows, Linux/BSD/and other\nUnix-likes.\n\n- RGB\n- [Hyperlinks](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda) (OSC 8)\n- Bracketed Paste\n- [Kitty Keyboard Protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/)\n- [Fancy underlines](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/underlines/) (undercurl, etc)\n- Mouse Shapes (OSC 22)\n- System Clipboard (OSC 52)\n- System Notifications (OSC 9)\n- System Notifications (OSC 777)\n- Synchronized Output (Mode 2026)\n- [Unicode Core](https://github.com/contour-terminal/terminal-unicode-core) (Mode 2027)\n- Color Mode Updates (Mode 2031)\n- [In-Band Resize Reports](https://gist.github.com/rockorager/e695fb2924d36b2bcf1fff4a3704bd83) (Mode 2048)\n- Images ([kitty graphics protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/))\n- [Explicit Width](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/blob/master/docs/text-sizing-protocol.rst) (width modifiers only)\n\n## Usage\n\n[Documentation](https://rockorager.github.io/libvaxis/#vaxis.Vaxis)\n\nThe library provides both a low level API suitable for making applications of\nany sort as well as a higher level framework. The low level API is suitable for\nmaking applications of any type, providing your own event loop, and gives you\nfull control over each cell on the screen.\n\nThe high level API, called `vxfw` (Vaxis framework), provides a Flutter-like\nstyle of API. The framework provides an application runtime which handles the\nevent loop, focus management, mouse handling, and more. Several widgets are\nprovided, and custom widgets are easy to build. This API is most likely what you\nwant to use for typical TUI applications.\n\n### Add libvaxis to your project\n\n```console\nzig fetch --save git+https://github.com/rockorager/libvaxis.git\n```\nAdd this to your build.zig\n\n```zig\n    const vaxis = b.dependency(\"vaxis\", .{\n        .target = target,\n        .optimize = optimize,\n    });\n\n    exe.root_module.addImport(\"vaxis\", vaxis.module(\"vaxis\"));\n```\n\nor for ZLS support\n\n```zig\n    // create module\n    const exe_mod = b.createModule(.{\n        .root_source_file = b.path(\"src/main.zig\"),\n        .target = target,\n        .optimize = optimize,\n    });\n    \n    // add vaxis dependency to module\n    const vaxis = b.dependency(\"vaxis\", .{\n        .target = target,\n        .optimize = optimize,\n    });\n    exe_mod.addImport(\"vaxis\", vaxis.module(\"vaxis\"));\n    \n    //create executable\n    const exe = b.addExecutable(.{\n        .name = \"project_foo\",\n        .root_module = exe_mod,\n    });\n    // install exe below\n```\n\n### vxfw (Vaxis framework)\n\nLet's build a simple button counter application. This example can be run using\nthe command `zig build example -Dexample=counter`. The below application has\nfull mouse support: the button *and mouse shape* will change style on hover, on\nclick, and has enough logic to cancel a press if the release does not occur over\nthe button. Try it! Click the button, move the mouse off the button and release.\nAll of this logic is baked into the base `Button` widget.\n\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst vaxis = @import(\"vaxis\");\nconst vxfw = vaxis.vxfw;\n\n/// Our main application state\nconst Model = struct {\n    /// State of the counter\n    count: u32 = 0,\n    /// The button.

A TTY instance\n2. An instance of Vaxis\n3. An event loop\n\nThe library provides a general purpose posix TTY implementation, as well as a\nmulti-threaded event loop implementation. Users of the library are encouraged to\nuse the event loop of their choice. The event loop is responsible for reading\nthe TTY, passing the read bytes to the vaxis parser, and handling events.\n\nA core feature of Vaxis is its ability to detect features via terminal queries\ninstead of relying on a terminfo database. This requires that the event loop\nalso handle these query responses and update the Vaxis.caps struct accordingly.\nSee the `Loop` implementation to see how this is done if writing your own event\nloop.\n\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst vaxis = @import(\"vaxis\");\nconst Cell = vaxis.Cell;\nconst TextInput = vaxis.widgets.TextInput;\nconst border = vaxis.widgets.border;\n\n// This can contain internal events as well as Vaxis events.\n// Internal events can be posted into the same queue as vaxis events to allow\n// for a single event loop with exhaustive switching. Booya\nconst Event = union(enum) {\n    key_press: vaxis.Key,\n    winsize: vaxis.Winsize,\n    focus_in,\n    foo: u8,\n};\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\n    defer {\n        const deinit_status = gpa.deinit();\n        //fail test; can't try in defer as defer is executed after we return\n        if (deinit_status == .leak) {\n            std.log.err(\"memory leak\", .{});\n        }\n    }\n    const alloc = gpa.allocator();\n\n    // Initialize a tty\n    var buffer: [1024]u8 = undefined;\n    var tty = try vaxis.Tty.init(&buffer);\n    defer tty.deinit();\n\n    // Initialize Vaxis\n    var vx = try vaxis.init(alloc, .{});\n    // deinit takes an optional allocator. If your program is exiting, you can\n    // choose to pass a null allocator to save some exit time.\n    defer vx.deinit(alloc, tty.writer());\n\n\n    // The event loop requires an intrusive init. We create an instance with\n    // stable pointers to Vaxis and our TTY, then init the instance. Doing so\n    // installs a signal handler for SIGWINCH on posix TTYs\n    //\n    // This event loop is thread safe. It reads the tty in a separate thread\n    var loop: vaxis.Loop(Event) = .{\n      .tty = &tty,\n      .vaxis = &vx,\n    };\n    try loop.init();\n\n    // Start the read loop. This puts the terminal in raw mode and begins\n    // reading user input\n    try loop.start();\n    defer loop.stop();\n\n    // Optionally enter the alternate screen\n    try vx.enterAltScreen(tty.writer());\n\n    // We'll adjust the color index every keypress for the border\n    var color_idx: u8 = 0;\n\n    // init our text input widget. The text input widget needs an allocator to\n    // store the contents of the input\n    var text_input = TextInput.init(alloc);\n    defer text_input.deinit();\n\n    // Sends queries to terminal to detect certain features. This should always\n    // be called after entering the alt screen, if you are using the alt screen\n    try vx.queryTerminal(tty.writer(), 1 * std.time.ns_per_s);\n\n    while (true) {\n        // nextEvent blocks until an event is in the queue\n        const event = loop.nextEvent();\n        // exhaustive switching ftw. Vaxis will send events if your Event enum\n        // has the fields for those events (ie \"key_press\", \"winsize\")\n        switch (event) {\n            .key_press => |key| {\n                color_idx = switch (color_idx) {\n                    255 => 0,\n                    else => color_idx + 1,\n                };\n                if (key.matches('c', .{ .ctrl = true })) {\n                    break;\n                } else if (key.matches('l', .{ .ctrl = true })) {\n                    vx.queueRefresh();\n                } else {\n                    try text_input.update(.{ .key_press = key });\n                }\n            },\n\n            // winsize events are sent to the application to ensure that all\n            // resizes occur in the main thread. This lets us avoid expensive\n            // locks on the screen. All applications must handle this event\n            // unless they aren't using a screen (IE only detecting features)\n            //\n            // The allocations are because we keep a copy of each cell to\n            // optimize renders. When resize is called, we allocated two slices:\n            // one for the screen, and one for our buffered screen. Each cell in\n            // the buffered screen contains an ArrayList(u8) to be able to store\n            // the grapheme for that cell. Each cell is initialized with a size\n            // of 1, which is sufficient for all of ASCII. Anything requiring\n            // more than one byte will incur an allocation on the first render\n            // after it is drawn. Thereafter, it will not allocate unless the\n            // screen is resized\n            .winsize => |ws| try vx.resize(alloc, tty.writer(), ws),\n            else => {},\n        }\n\n        // vx.window() returns the root window. This window is the size of the\n        // terminal and can spawn child windows as logical areas. Child windows\n        // cannot draw outside of their bounds\n        const win = vx.window();\n\n        // Clear the entire space because we are drawing in immediate mode.\n        // vaxis double buffers the screen. This new frame will be compared to\n        // the old and only updated cells will be drawn\n        win.clear();\n\n        // Create a style\n        const style: vaxis.Style = .{\n            .fg = .{ .index = color_idx },\n        };\n\n        // Create a bordered child window\n        const child = win.child(.{\n            .x_off = win.width / 2 - 20,\n            .y_off = win.height / 2 - 3,\n            .width = 40 ,\n            .height = 3 ,\n            .border = .{\n                .where = .all,\n                .style = style,\n            },\n        });\n\n        // Draw the text_input in the child window\n        text_input.draw(child);\n\n        // Render the screen. Using a buffered writer will offer much better\n\t// performance, but is not required\n        try vx.render(tty.writer());\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome.
