  "readme": "# zig-essence\n\nLow-level minimal allocation implementation of Relic's funky formats in Zig with comments and clearly named variables.\n\nSGAs: Headers should work for all versions of SGAs, but more high-level code and complex operations are only tested on AoE4 SGAs. \n\n## Getting sgatool\n\nYou can grab a copy of `sgatool`, the actually executable portion of `zig-essence`, from the latest successful CI run, the latest release (soon), or by compiling the program yourself.\n\n### Compiling\n\nFirst, install [Zig](https://ziglang.org/). Then:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/aoemods/zig-sga\ncd zig-sga\nzig build\n# Output in ./zig-out/bin!\n\n# Or to run it right away (useful for developers)\nzig build sgatool -- [args]\n```\n\n## Using as a Library\n\nSee `tools/sgatool.zig` and `build.zig` for an example of how `zig-essence` can be used as a library in Zig!\n\n## Prior Art\n\nCredit where credit's due!\n\nThanks Janne for the [awesome blog post](https://janne252.dev/content/2021/coh3-pre-alpha-extract-sga) as well as the [SGA viewer tooling](https://github.com/Janne252/essence-archive-viewer) that inspired this effort. A dozen lines of documentation are based off of a table in Janne's blog post. \\<3\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\nAll files in `dump` are also MIT licensed and generated by other SGA tools.
