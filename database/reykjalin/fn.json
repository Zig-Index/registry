Fönn is a code editor powered by `libfn`.\n\nMy primary goal is to eventually have a modern, capable TUI code editor that's powered by a reusable\nediting engine. The engine itself will eventually be exposed as a static library with a C API, but\nmade in Zig. If I can get this project that far that is :)\n\nA secondary goal is for `fn` to eventually have both a GUI and a TUI powered by this same text\nediting \"engine\".\n\n## Fönn (TUI)\n\n❄️ Fönn: A code editor for _fun_.\n\n![Screenshot of the fn TUI modifying its own source code](./screenshots/fn.webp)\n\nThis is currently a toy project, but `fn` is stable enough that I'm exclusively using it when working on changes to the editor.\n\nMy primary goal is to have a modern, capable TUI code editor.\nA secondary goal is for `fn` to eventually have both a GUI and a TUI powered by the same text editing \"engine\".\n\n### Build instructions\n\n```sh\n# Debug build in ./zig-out/bin/fn.\nzig build\n\n# Run debug build in current directory.\nzig build run\n\n# Open a file with debug build.\nzig build run -- path/to/file\n\n# Release build in ~/.local/bin/fn.\nzig build --release=fast --prefix ~/.local\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```sh\n$ fn --help\nUsage: fn [file]\n\nGeneral options:\n\n  -h, --help     Print fn help\n  -v, --version  Print fn version\n\n```\n\n## libfn\n\nIf you're working on a Zig project and want to play around with the library itself you can do so by\ninstalling fun with `zig fetch --save git+https://git.sr.ht/~reykjalin/fn`.\n\n### Build instructions\n\n```sh\n# Make sure libfn builds.\nzig build check\n\n# Run tests.\nzig build test\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n```sh\n$ zig fetch --save git+https://tangled.org/@reykjalin.org/fn\n```\n\nThen, in your `build.zig`:\n\n```zig\nconst target = b.standardTargetOptions(.{});\nconst optimize = b.standardOptimizeOption(.{});\n\nconst libfn_dep = b.dependency(\"libfn\", .{ .optimize = optimize, .target = target });\n\nconst root_module = b.createModule(.{\n    .root_source_file = b.path(\"src/tui/main.zig\"),\n    .target = target,\n    .optimize = optimize,\n});\n\nroot_module.addImport(\"libfn\", libfn_dep.module(\"libfn\"));\n\nconst exe = b.addExecutable(.{\n    .name = \"example\",\n    .root_module = root_module,\n});\n\nb.installArtifact(exe);\n```\n\nand then you can import it in your code:\n\n```zig\nconst libfn = @import(\"libfn\");\n\n// ...\n\nconst editor: libfn.Editor = .init(allocator);\n```\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n- [Tim Culverhouse](https://rockorager.dev) - for his incredible work on [libvaxis](https://github.com/rockorager/libvaxis).\n- [CJ van den Berg](https://github.com/neurocyte) - for his inspiring work on [Flow Control](https://flow-control.dev).\n- [David Vanderson](https://github.com/david-vanderson) - for his work on [DVUI](https://david-vanderson.github.io/), the inspiration for the TUI framework used to develop Fönn.\n",
