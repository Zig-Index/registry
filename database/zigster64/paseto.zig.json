  "readme": "# paseto.zig\n\nA Zig implementation of Paseto token encode / decode as an alternative to JWT\n\nThis implementation is assumed to be used in a web backend, therefore : \n- Implements local v4 only\n- Takes an arena allocator (which your handler should provide), which makes MM much simpler\n  and allows for the JSON decoder to use the parseFromSliceLeaky variant\n\nTested and works with http.zig 0.15.1\n\n# Install\n\n1) Add paseto.zig as a dependency in your `build.zig.zon`:\n\n```bash\nzig fetch --save \"git+https://github.com/zigster64/paseto.zig#master\"\n```\n\n2) In your `build.zig`, add the `paseto` module as an import on your executable target\n\n# Test\n\n`zig build run` will run a local test of encoding a struct into JSON, encoding it into \na paseto token, then decoding it, then printing it.\n\n# Encode - Create a local token with encrypted payload\n\n```\n/// Generates a PASETO v4.local token from a payload and secret key\n/// payload: any type that can be serialized to JSON\n/// secret_key: exactly 32 bytes for ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption\npub fn encode(\n    arena: Allocator,\n    payload: anytype,\n    secret_key: []const u8,\n) ![]u8\n```\n\n# Decode - Validate a token and extract its payload\n\n```\n/// Decodes a PASETO v4.local token as JSON, and then parses the\n/// JSON payload into the given comptime struct. \n/// Returns an instance of that type\npub fn decode(\n    arena: Allocator,\n    token: []const u8,\n    secret_key: []const u8,\n    comptime T: type,\n) !T\n```\n",
