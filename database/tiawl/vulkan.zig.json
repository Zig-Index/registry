  "readme": "# vulkan.zig\n\nThis is a fork of [hexops/vulkan-headers][1] which is itself a fork of [KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Headers][2].\n\n## Why this forkception ?\n\nThe intention under this fork is the same as [hexops][6] had when they forked [KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Headers][2]: package the headers for [Zig][3]. So:\n* Unnecessary files have been deleted,\n* The build system has been replaced with `build.zig`.\n\nHowever this repository has subtle differences for maintainability tasks:\n* No shell scripting,\n* A cron runs every day to check [KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Headers][2]. Then it updates this repository if a new release is available.\n\n## How to use it\n\nThe current usage of this repository is centered around [tiawl/glfw.zig][3] compilation. But you could use it for your own projects. Headers are here and there are no planned evolution to modify them. See [tiawl/glfw.zig][3] to see how you can use it.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThe [Zig][3] part of this package is relying on the latest [Zig][3] release (0.15.2) and will only be updated for the next one.\n\nHere the repositories' version used by this fork:\n* [KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Headers](https://github.com/tiawl/vulkan.zig/blob/trunk/.references/vulkan)\n\n## CICD reminder\n\nThese repositories are automatically updated when a new release is available:\n* [tiawl/glfw.zig][4]\n\nThis repository is automatically updated when a new release is available from these repositories:\n* [KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Headers][2]\n* [tiawl/toolbox][5]\n\n## `zig build` options\n\nThese additional options have been implemented for maintainability tasks:\n```\n  -Dfetch   Update .references folder and build.zig.zon then stop execution\n  -Dupdate  Update binding\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis repository is not subject to a unique License:\n\nThe parts of this repository originated from this repository are dedicated to the public domain. See the LICENSE file for more details.\n\n**For other parts, it is subject to the License restrictions their respective owners choosed.
