  "readme": "# shaderc.zig\n\nThis is a fork of [google/shaderc][1] packaged for [Zig][2]\n\n## Why this fork ?\n\nThe intention under this fork is to package [google/shaderc][1] for [Zig][2]. So:\n* Unnecessary files have been deleted,\n* The build system has been replaced with `build.zig`,\n* A cron runs every day to check [google/shaderc][1]. Then it updates this repository if a new release is available.\n\n## How to use it\n\nThe goal of this repository is not to provide a [Zig][2] binding for [google/shaderc][1]. There are at least as many legit ways as possible to make a binding as there are active accounts on Github. So you are not going to find an answer for this question here. The point of this repository is to abstract the [google/shaderc][1] compilation process with [Zig][2] (which is not new comers friendly and not easy to maintain) to let you focus on your application. So you can use **shaderc.zig**:\n- as raw (see into the `example` directory),\n- as a daily updated interface for your [Zig][2] binding of [google/shaderc][1].\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThe [Zig][2] part of this package is relying on the latest [Zig][2] release (0.15.2) and will only be updated for the next one.\n\nHere the repositories' version used by this fork:\n* [google/shaderc](https://github.com/tiawl/shaderc.zig/blob/trunk/.references/shaderc)\n\n## CICD reminder\n\nThese repositories are automatically updated when a new release is available:\n* [tiawl/spaceporn][3]\n\nThis repository is automatically updated when a new release is available from these repositories:\n* [google/shaderc][1]\n* [tiawl/toolbox][4]\n* [tiawl/glslang.zig][5]\n* [tiawl/spirv.zig][6]\n\n## `zig build` options\n\nThese additional options have been implemented for maintainability tasks:\n```\n  -Dfetch   Update .references folder and build.zig.zon then stop execution\n  -Dupdate  Update binding\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis repository is not subject to a unique License:\n\nThe parts of this repository originated from this repository are dedicated to the public domain. See the LICENSE file for more details.\n\n**For other parts, it is subject to the License restrictions their respective owners choosed.
