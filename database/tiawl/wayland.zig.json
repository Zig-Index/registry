  "readme": "# wayland.zig\n\nThis is a fork of [hexops/wayland-headers][1] which itself gather various [Wayland][2] headers [GLFW][3] needs.\n\n## Why this forkception ?\n\nThe intention under this fork is the same as [hexops][9] had when they opened their repository: gather [Wayland][2] headers and package them to compile [GLFW][3] with [Zig][4].\n\nHowever this repository has subtle differences for maintainability tasks:\n* No shell scripting,\n* A cron runs every day to check [Wayland][2] repositories. Then it updates this repository if a new release is available.\n\n## How to use it\n\nThe current usage of this repository is centered around [tiawl/glfw.zig][3] compilation. But you could use it for your own projects. Headers are here and there are no planned evolution to modify them. See [tiawl/glfw.zig][3] to see how you can use it. Maybe for your own need, some headers are missing. If it happens, open an issue: this repository is open to potential usage evolution.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThe [Zig][4] part of this package is relying on the latest [Zig][4] release (0.15.1) and will only be updated for the next one.\n\nHere the repositories' version used by this fork:\n* [wayland/wayland](https://github.com/tiawl/wayland.zig/blob/trunk/.references/wayland)\n* [wayland/wayland-protocols](https://github.com/tiawl/wayland.zig/blob/trunk/.references/wayland-protocols)\n\n## CICD reminder\n\nThese repositories are automatically updated when a new release is available:\n* [tiawl/glfw.zig][5]\n\nThis repository is automatically updated when a new release is available from these repositories:\n* [wayland/wayland][6]\n* [wayland/wayland-protocols][7]\n* [tiawl/toolbox][8]\n\n## `zig build` options\n\nThese additional options have been implemented for maintainability tasks:\n```\n  -Dfetch   Update .references folder and build.zig.zon then stop execution\n  -Dupdate  Update binding\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis repository is not subject to a unique License:\n\nThe parts of this repository originated from this repository are dedicated to the public domain.
