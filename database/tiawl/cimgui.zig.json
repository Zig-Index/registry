  "readme": "# cimgui.zig\n\nThis is a fork of [ocornut/imgui][1] packaged for [Zig][2]\n\n## Why this fork ?\n\nThe intention under this fork is to package [ocornut/imgui][1] for [Zig][2]. So:\n* Unnecessary files have been deleted,\n* The build system has been replaced with `build.zig`,\n* [dearimgui/dear_bindings][3] generates the C binding,\n* A cron runs every day to check [ocornut/imgui][2] and [dearimgui/dear_bindings][3]. Then it updates this repository if a new release is available.\n\n## How to use it\n\nThe goal of this repository is not to provide a [Zig][2] binding for [ocornut/imgui][1]. There are at least as many legit ways as possible to make a binding as there are active accounts on Github. So you are not going to find an answer for this question here. The point of this repository is to abstract the [ocornut/imgui][1] compilation process with [Zig][2] (which is not new comers friendly and not easy to maintain) to let you focus on your application. So you can use **cimgui.zig**:\n- as raw (see the [examples directory](https://github.com/tiawl/cimgui.zig/blob/trunk/examples)),\n- as a daily updated interface for your [Zig][2] binding of [ocornut/imgui][1] (see [here][10] for a private usage).\n\n### cimgui.zig as a library\nIf you want to add `cimgui.zig` as a library to your project, you can do the following (do know that it requires a zig version `>0.13`) :\n\nFetch this repository :\n```sh\n$ zig fetch --save git+https://github.com/tiawl/cimgui.zig\n```\n\nAdd it to your `build.zig` :\n```diff\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n+const cimgui = @import(\"cimgui_zig\");\n\npub fn build(b: *std.Build) void {\n    // -- snip --\n\n+    const cimgui_dep = b.dependency(\"cimgui_zig\", .{\n+        .target = target,\n+        .optimize = optimize,\n+        .platform = cimgui.Platform.GLFW,\n+        .renderer = cimgui.Renderer.Vulkan,\n+    });\n+\n+    const cimgui_lib = cimgui_dep.artifact(\"cimgui\");\n\n    // The following conditional is only necessary for OpenGL backends:\n+    if (cimgui_lib.root_module.import_table.get(\"gl\")) |gl_module| {\n+        exe.root_module.addImport(\"gl\", gl_module);\n+    }\n\n    // Where `exe` represents your executable/library to link to\n+    exe.linkLibrary(cimgui_lib);\n\n    // -- snip --\n}\n```\n\nAnd that's it ! You're ready to go ! See the `examples` directory on how to move forward from there.\n\n## Backends\nThe backends are separated in two categories : the platforms (handling windows, events, ...) and the renderers (draw to screen, ..).\n\n### Platform\n  - [GLFW][4]\n  - [SDL3][11]\n  - [SDLGPU3][11] (technically a renderer but needs linkage againt OpenGL/Vulkan)\n\n### Renderers\n  - [Vulkan][5]\n  - [OpenGL][12]\n\n> As you can see, these backends do not support all of those supported by ImGUI. Adding a backend is a bit of work because of the needed *maintenance*. Please do not ask for backends to be added if you don't feel like adding them yourselves !\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThe [Zig][2] part of this package is relying on the latest [Zig][2] release (0.15.1) and will only be updated for the next one.\n\nHere the repositories' version used by this fork:\n* [ocornut/imgui](https://github.com/tiawl/cimgui.zig/blob/trunk/.references/imgui)\n\nCurrently there are no tags/release for [dearimgui/dear_bindings][3] so **cimgui.zig** is relying on the last commit.\n\nFor backends see [the build.zig.zon](https://github.com/tiawl/cimgui.zig/blob/trunk/build.zig.zon)\n\n## CICD reminder\n\nThese repositories are automatically updated when a new release is available:\n* [tiawl/spaceporn][6]\n\nThis repository is automatically updated when a new release is available from these repositories:\n* [ocornut/imgui][1]\n* [dearimgui/dear_bindings][3]\n* [tiawl/toolbox][7]\n* [tiawl/vulkan.zig][8]\n* [tiawl/glfw.zig][9]\n* [castholm/SDL][13]\n* [castholm/zigglgen][14]\n\n## `zig build` options\n\nThese additional options have been implemented for maintainability tasks:\n```\n  -Dfetch=[bool]               Update .references folder and build.zig.zon then stop execution\n  -Dupdate=[bool]              Update binding\n  -Drenderer=[enum]            Specify the renderer backend\n                                 Supported Values:\n                                   Vulkan\n                                   OpenGL3\n  -Dplatform=[enum]            Specify the platform backend\n                                 Supported Values:\n                                   GLFW\n                                   SDL3\n                                   SDLGPU3\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis repository is not subject to a unique License:\n\nThe parts of this repository originated from this repository are dedicated to the public domain.
