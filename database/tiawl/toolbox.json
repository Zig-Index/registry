It is actively used in it. BUT it is also possible to use it in other projects. However maybe some features are always binded to its original conception guideline. For this reason, this repository is open to breaking proposals. So if you are using it for your own needs, expect breaking (but also documented) changes for each release.\n\nIf you want to see how to use it you can check repositories list into the [CICD reminder section](https://github.com/tiawl/toolbox/tree/trunk#cicd-reminder).\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThe [Zig][2] part of this package is relying on the latest [Zig][2] release (0.15.1) and will only be updated for the next one.\n\n## CICD reminder\n\nThese repositories are automatically updated when a new release is available:\n* [tiawl/vulkan.zig][3]\n* [tiawl/wayland.zig][4]\n* [tiawl/X11.zig][5]\n* [tiawl/glfw.zig][6]\n* [tiawl/cimgui.zig][7]\n* [tiawl/spirv.zig][8]\n* [tiawl/glslang.zig][9]\n* [tiawl/shaderc.zig][10]\n\n## License\n\nThis repository is dedicated to the public domain.
