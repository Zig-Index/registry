  "readme": "# spirv.zig\n\nThis is a fork of [hexops/spirv-tools][1] which itself is a fork of [KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools][2].\n\n## Why this forkception ?\n\nThe intention under this fork is the same as [hexops][7] had when they forked [KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools][2]: package the headers for [Zig][4]. So:\n* Unnecessary files have been deleted,\n* The build system has been replaced with `build.zig`.\n\nHowever this repository has subtle differences for maintainability tasks:\n* No shell scripting,\n* A cron runs every day to check [KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools][2] and [KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Headers][3]. Then it updates this repository if a new release is available.\n\n## How to use it\n\nThe current usage of this repository is centered around [tiawl/shaderc.zig][3] compilation. But you could use it for your own projects. Headers are here and there are no planned evolution to modify them. See [tiawl/shaderc.zig][3] to see how you can use it. Maybe for your own need, some headers are missing. If it happens, open an issue: this repository is open to potential usage evolution.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThe [Zig][4] part of this package is relying on the latest [Zig][4] release (0.15.1) and will only be updated for the next one.\n\nHere the repositories' version used by this fork:\n* [KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools](https://github.com/tiawl/spirv.zig/blob/trunk/.references/spirv-tools)\n* [KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Headers](https://github.com/tiawl/spirv.zig/blob/trunk/.references/spirv)\n\n## CICD reminder\n\nThese repositories are automatically updated when a new release is available:\n* [tiawl/shaderc.zig][5]\n\nThis repository is automatically updated when a new release is available from these repositories:\n* [KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools][2]\n* [KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Headers][3]\n* [microsoft/mimalloc][8]\n* [tiawl/toolbox][6]\n\n## `zig build` options\n\nThese additional options have been implemented for maintainability tasks:\n```\n  -Dfetch   Update .references folder and build.zig.zon then stop execution\n  -Dupdate  Update binding\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis repository is not subject to a unique License:\n\nThe parts of this repository originated from this repository are dedicated to the public domain.
