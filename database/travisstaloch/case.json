  "readme": "# case\na case conversion and detection library in zig\n\ncases supported: camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case, CONSTANT_CASE, kebab-case, Header-Case, lower case, UPPER CASE, Capital Case\n\n## [lib.zig](src/lib.zig)\n\nuses readers and writers throughout. supports non-allocating and comptime use. \n\n* `to(case, reader, writer)` - converts to case from reader into writer\n* `of(text)` - return `Case` of text. may be 'unknown'.\n* `bufTo(buf, case, text)` - writes converted text to buf in specified case\n* `allocTo(allocator, case, text)` - allocates a buffer and writes converted text to buffer in specified case\n* `allocToZ()` - same as allocTo() but null terminated\n* `comptimeTo(case, text)` - allocates buffer at comptime\n* `comptimeToLen(case, text, len)` - same as comptimeTo() but allows user to specify buffer len\n* `length(case, text)` - returns length needed to convert text to case\n* `isCamel(text)` - true if text case is camel. similar methods for each case\n* `upper(reader, writer, opts), camel(reader, writer)` - conversion functions for each case. upper(), lower() and capital() have an additional opts param.\n* `toExt(case, reader, writer, opts)` there are variants of all 'to' methods such as `toExt(), lengthExt()`. these are for upper, lower and capital cases when you want to specify Options.\n* `opts: Options`\n  * fill - string used to replace non alpha numeric characters.  default empty.  when empty, don't replace non alpha numeric characters.\n  * apostrophe - keep / remove.  default keep.\n\n## c api\n\n* [c_api.zig](src/c_api.zig) - exports methods similar to most public zig methods above\n* [case.h](src/case.h)\n  * `Case` enum guaranteed to be in sync with `Case` enum in lib.zig\n\n## tests\n\n`$ zig build test` runs the following\n  * [tests.zig](src/tests.zig) - pretty thorough zig tests which also test the c api methods\n  * [test.c](src/test.c) - a small demo program which exercises the c api\n\n\n## build \n`$ zig build`\n\ncreates `zig-out/lib/libcase.a` and `zig-out/include/case.h`\n\n* zig package manager support\n\n## related\n[nbubna/Case](https://github.com/nbubna/Case)\n\n## inspiration\nthanks to [cmgriffing](https://github.com/cmgriffing) for suggesting this\n",
