Debugging is simple since you can run your debugger just like with any normal flat executable and use the built in filtering to narrow down what test or set of tests gets run.\n\n# Example\n\nCheck the example program under `example/` with a main program and a separate test program. \n\n## Test module\n\nA module of tests looks like:\n\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst testz = @import(\"testz\");\n\npub fn allowNonTestzErrorsTest() !void {\n    const mem = try std.heap.page_allocator.alloc(u8, 10);\n    defer std.heap.page_allocator.free(mem);\n    try testz.expectEqual(true, true);\n}\n\npub fn alwaysFailTest() !void {\n    try testz.fail();\n}\n\npub fn successTest() !void {\n    try testz.expectEqual(12, 12);\n    try testz.expectEqualStr(\"hello\", \"hello\");\n    try testz.expectNotEqual(10, 20);\n    try testz.expectNotEqualStr(\"hello\", \"world\");\n    try testz.expectTrue(true);\n    try testz.expectFalse(false);\n}\n\npub fn skip_Test() !void {\n    // nothing to see here.\n}\n```\n\nThe test functions are simply any public function in a module you pass into `discoverTests`.  The `testz` library has a number of `expectXYZ` functions you can use to make assertions in your code.  If one fails, `testz` will capture the name of the failed test, error message, and stack trace (with contextual lines).\n\n### Test Runner \n\nThis is a test runner program using the built-in `testzRunner` method that you could use in your project, which handles standard argument parsing.  It also shows test discovery by passing in modules as groups to the `discoverTests` method.\n\n```tests/main.zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst testz = @import(\"testz\");\n\nconst DiscoveredTests = testz.discoverTests(.{ \n    testz.Group{ .name = \"Expect Tests\", .tag = \"expect\", .mod = @import(\"./expect_tests.zig\") }, \n    testz.Group{ .name = \"Misc Tests\", .tag = \"misc\", .mod = @import(\"./misc_tests.zig\") } \n});\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    try testz.testzRunner(DiscoveredTests);\n}\n```\n\nThe function `testsz.discoverTests`, takes a tuple of either direct module `@import`s, or `testz.Group` structs, which contain a group name and tag for filtering as well as the module to scan for test functions.\n\n### A `build.zig` Setup\n\nRun `zig fetch --save https://github.com/srjilarious/testz` to add `testz` as a dependency in your `build.zig.zon` file.\n\nNext, in your `build.zig`, you would create a new exe for your tests and add:\n\n```zig\n    const testzMod = b.dependency(\"testz\", .{});\n    [...]\n    testsExe.root_module.addImport(\"testz\", testzMod.module(\"testz\"));\n```\nSee the project under `example/` for how this looks in a simple dummy project.\n\n# Planned Features\n\nThe library has all of the initial features I set out to implement.  New releases will mostly be to keep up to date with the latest zig versions as they get released.\n\nFeel free to open an issue or open a PR if there is a feature you'd like to see!\n\n",
