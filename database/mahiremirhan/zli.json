This project provides a powerful framework for building command-line tools in Zig. With **zli**, you can create ergonomic and high-performance CLI applications with ease.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n1. [Introduction](#introduction)\n2. [Features](#features)\n3.

[Links](#links)\n\n## Introduction\n\n**zli** is designed to simplify the process of building command-line applications. Zig is a low-level programming language that emphasizes performance and safety. By leveraging Zig's strengths, **zli** allows developers to focus on functionality without worrying about the underlying complexities.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Fast Performance**: Built on Zig's efficient compilation and execution model.\n- **Ergonomic Design**: Intuitive API that makes it easy to create and manage commands.\n- **Modular Architecture**: Easily extend functionality with custom modules.\n- **Rich Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples to help you get started.\n- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo get started with **zli**, you need to install the framework. Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/mahiremirhan/zli/releases) section to download the latest version. Follow the instructions to install and execute the framework.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nAfter installing **zli**, you can create a new CLI application. Here’s how:\n\n1. Open your terminal.\n2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.\n3. Run the following command to create a new project:\n\n   ```bash\n   zli create my-cli-app\n   ```\n\n4. Navigate into your new project directory:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd my-cli-app\n   ```\n\n5. Open the main source file in your favorite text editor.\n\n## Usage\n\nCreating commands in **zli** is straightforward. Here’s a simple example of how to define a command:\n\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst zli = @import(\"zli\");\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    const app = zli.Application.init(\"my-cli-app\", \"1.0.0\");\n\n    app.command(\"greet\", \"Greet the user\", greet);\n\n    try app.run();\n}\n\nfn greet(args: *zli.CommandArgs) !void {\n    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\n    try stdout.print(\"Hello, {}!\\n\", .{args.get(\"name\")});\n}\n```\n\n### Running Your Application\n\nOnce you have defined your commands, you can run your application from the terminal:\n\n```bash\n./my-cli-app greet --name=\"World\"\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nHello, World!\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions to **zli**! If you have suggestions, improvements, or bug fixes, please follow these steps:\n\n1. Fork the repository.\n2. Create a new branch for your feature or fix.\n3. Make your changes and commit them.\n4.
