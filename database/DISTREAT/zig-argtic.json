  "readme": "# zig-argtic\n\nA library for parsing command-line options, arguments, and sub-commands.\n\n_Build using zig version: `0.14.1`_\n\n## How does it compare to the POSIX and GNU conventions?\n\n- An option requires a long name (GNU compatible; eg. `--long-option`)\n- An option may have a single char name and start with one hyphen (similar to POSIX)\n- An option may have a value (GNU compliant)\n  - ...directly following as the next index inside the argument vector (eg. `-o file.txt`)\n  - but may not follow directly after the option name (incompatible GNU/incompatible POSIX; eg. `-ofile.txt`)\n- Options may be grouped in any order (POSIX compliant; eg. `-o -v` -> `-ov`)\n- Options may appear multiple times (POSIX)\n- Options precede required arguments (POSIX)\n- Options may be supplied in any order (GNU)\n- Options may be separated into option name and value through the use of an equal sign (GNU complicant; eg. `--name=value`)\n\n[Source: POSIX Conventions](http://www.iitk.ac.in/esc101/05Aug/tutorial/essential/attributes/_posix.html)\n\n[Source: GNU Conventions/Additions](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Argument-Syntax.html)\n\n## Example\n\n```zig\n// simple example - reduced to a minimum\nconst specification = argtic.ArgumentSpecification{\n    .name = \"exe\",\n    .positionals = &[_]argtic.Positional{\n        .{ .name = \"value\" },\n    },\n};\n\nconst argument_vector = try std.process.argsAlloc(allocator);\ndefer std.process.argsFree(allocator, argument_vector);\n\nconst arguments = try argtic.ArgumentProcessor.parse(allocator, specification, argument_vector[1..]);\ndefer arguments.deinit();\n\nstd.log.info(\"{s}\", .{arguments.getArgument(\"value\").?});\n```\n\nFor more thorough examples, visit `examples/` and `src/tests.zig`.\n\n[Required Arguments](https://github.com/DISTREAT/zig-argtic/blob/master/examples/positionals.zig)\n\n[Optional Arguments](https://github.com/DISTREAT/zig-argtic/blob/master/examples/optionals.zig)\n\n[Optional Positionals](https://github.com/DISTREAT/zig-argtic/blob/master/examples/extra_positionals.zig)\n\n[Subcommands](https://github.com/DISTREAT/zig-argtic/blob/master/examples/subcommands.zig)\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe documentation is created in the directory `docs/` when running `zig build`.\n\n[Documentation](https://distreat.github.io/zig-argtic/)\n\n## Appendix\n\nThis project was likely one of the most challenging projects I have written, especially because I struggle with parsers in general. Nonetheless, I did realize this project in the end and am more or less content, although not happy.\n\nThere is a lot of missing work, but I assume it's usable to the point where I could use it in future projects. To put it in perspective, this is probably already the 10th iteration I have written, and I finally got a decent structure down that I assume to be scalable and maintainable.\n\nAnyway, don't underestimate the project of writing a CLI argument parser that supports subcommands, flags (with multiple value syntax), compound flags, and positional arguments. This project tested my limits again and agian and even made me consider using a PEG or regular expression parser - also - it's not like I started programming yesterday. Notably, the API took me some time to figure out, which is funny considering it's simplicity.\n\nEvery single stage of this project tested me and my idealistic bed-of-rose-loving ass. Considering all I've just said, I'd recommend writing an argument parser once in your life - it just makes you feel cured of all previous projects (or sad about your life choices) - because I hated it, especially in the final half-assed stages.\n\nNow that I succeeded (more or less), you may consider this my magnum opus of yak shaving.\n",
