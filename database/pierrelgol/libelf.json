  "readme": "# libelf\n\n**libelf** is a lightweight ELF file parsing library written in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/), designed for simplicity, modularity, correctness, and ease of integration into low-level projects.\n\n> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**: This library is still under active development. The API and behavior are subject to change. Use at your own risk.\n\n## Goals\n\n- Provide a faithfull translation 1:1 of elf.h\n- Provide a convenient namespaced organization of Elf constants.\n- Provide a minimal, dependency-free ELF parser in Zig\n- Support reading headers, sections, and common ELF structures\n- Be suitable for use in embedded and systems programming contexts\n\n## Status\n\nCurrently supports:\n- Some core constants and enums\n\nPlanned features:\n- Basic ELF header parsing\n- Program and section header interpretation\n- Symbol table parsing\n- Relocation entries\n- Versioning, notes, and dynamic sections\n- DWARF and debugging info (possibly as a separate extension)\n",
