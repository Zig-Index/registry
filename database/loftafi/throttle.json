  "readme": "## Throttle\n\nThis project provides a rudimentary way to throttle any type of request or\naction. It could be used to throttle sign in requests based on a user's\nemail address, or the origin IP address.\n\nCurrent version compatible with Zig 0.14.\n\nThis code is for my personal use, and works for my purposes. There is no\nguarantee that it will be suitable and reliable for your purposes. The\ncode is released under the MIT licence, you are free to use it, but\nstrongly urged to fully test that the code functions correctly for your\nuse cases.\n\n## How to use\n\nLimit calls to an API to 5 per second, or lockout for one minute\n\n```zig\npub const Throttle = @import(\"throttle\").Throttle;\npub const us_per_s = std.time.us_per_s;\n\nvar counter = Throttle.init(us_per_s * 1, 5, us_per_s * 60);\nif (counter.isThrottled()) {\n    std.log.warn(\"Try again later\");\n}\n```\n\nLimit signin attempts on an email address to 5 per minute, or\nlockout for 5 minutes.\n\n```zig\npub const StringThrottleCache = @import(\"throttle\").StringThrottleCache;\npub const us_per_min = std.time.us_per_min;\n\nvar counter = StringThrottleCache.init(us_per_min * 1, 5, us_per_m * 5);\nconst email = \"john@example.com\";\nif (counter.isThrottled(email)) {\n    std.log.warn(\"Try again later\");\n}\n```\n\nLimit  signin attemps from an IP address to 5 attempts per\nminute, or lockout for 2 minutes.\n\n```zig\npub const ThrottleCache = @import(\"throttle\").ThrottleCache;\npub const us_per_min = std.time.us_per_min;\n\nvar counter = ThrottleCache.init(i128, us_per_min * 1, 5, us_per_min * 2);\nif (counter.isThrottled(ip_address) {\n    std.log.warn(\"Try again later\");\n}\n```\n",
