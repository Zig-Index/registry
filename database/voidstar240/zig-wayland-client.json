  "readme": "# Zig Wayland Client\nA zig native wayland client library. This library is not designed to identically\nreplicate the functionality of the lib-wayland-client library from the mainline\nwayland project. This is instead a new take on interfacing with wayland by\nfocusing on the primitives of the wayland protocol.\n\nFor in depth usage information see `window_app` in the `examples/` directory.\nThe core wayland protocol isn't particularly useful on its own so the\n`window_app` example uses the `XDG Shell` and `XDG Decoration` protocol\nextensions to create a proper desktop style window. For the example to work your\ncompositor will have to support at least `XDG Shell`. If your compositor doesn't\nsupport `XDG Decoration` the content will still show, but the window won't have\ndecorations (this is the case with GNOME/Mutter).\n\n## Installation\n```\nzig fetch --save git+https://github.com/voidstar240/zig-wayland-client\n```\n\n## Contribution\nThis project is by no means complete, however it is usable. If you encounter\nany bugs or have any suggestions please create an issue. If you are a developer\nand want to improve the project feel free to create a pull request with your\nchanges.\n",
