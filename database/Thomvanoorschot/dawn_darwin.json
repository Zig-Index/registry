  "readme": "# Dawn Native for macOS (Pre-built)\n\nThis repository contains a pre-built static library of [Google's Dawn Native](https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn) for macOS (universal binary supporting both x86_64 and arm64 architectures).\n\n## Version\n\nBuilt from Dawn Native version **v20250618.223156**\n\n## What is Dawn Native?\n\nDawn Native is Google's cross-platform implementation of the WebGPU standard, providing native access to modern graphics APIs like Metal, Vulkan, and D3D12.\n\n## Build Process\n\nThis library was built using the following steps:\n\n```bash\ncp scripts/standalone.gclient .gclient\ngclient sync\ncmake -G Ninja \\\n  -S . -B out/macos-universal \\\n  -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF \\\n  -DDAWN_FETCH_DEPENDENCIES=ON \\\n  -DDAWN_ENABLE_INSTALL=ON \\\n  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \\\n  -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=\"x86_64;arm64\"\ncmake --build out/macos-universal --config Release\n```\n\nThe individual static libraries were then merged into a single `dawn.a` file using `libtool`.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use this pre-built library in your Zig project, add it as a dependency and link the static library:\n\n```zig\nif (example_project.rootModuleTarget().os.tag == .macos) {\n    const dawn_darwin = b.dependency(\"dawn_darwin\", .{});\n    example_project.addObjectFile(dawn_darwin.path(\"dawn.a\"));\n}\n```\n\nReplace `example_project` with your actual project variable name.\n\n## Example\n\nThe Zignite repository features a full example of how to use this.\nhttps://github.com/Thomvanoorschot/zignite",
