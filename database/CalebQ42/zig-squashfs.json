  "readme": "# zig-squashfs\n\nThis is my experiments to learn Zig. Might amount to something. Might not.\n\n## Current State\n\nKinda works as a library, but currently has known memory leaks. `unsquashfs` is missing a lot of features (and will probably never match the official unsquashfs). Extraction is stupidly slow and uses too many resources.\n",
