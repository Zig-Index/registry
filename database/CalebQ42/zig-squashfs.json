  "readme": "# zig-squashfs\n\nThis is my experiments to learn Zig. Might amount to something. Might not.\n\nA library and application to decompress or view squashfs archives.\n\n## Current State\n\nOverall works, but currently is completely single threaded and is missing some features. Extraction is slow. Only properly work on Linux, any other OSes probably won't work fully.\n\n## Build options\n\n> `-Duse_c_libs`\n\nInstead of using Zig's standard library for decompression \n\n> `-Dversion`\n\nSets the version of `unsquashfs` shown when `--version` is passed.\n\n## Capabilities\n\nMost features are present except for the following:\n\n* mod_time is not set on extraction\n* xattrs are not applied on extraction\n* Only zstd c library is implemented (all others result in error.TODO).\n* When using Zig decompression libraries then lzo and lz4 compression types are unavailable. I don't _really_ plan on spending the time to find and validate a library since neither is popular.\n",
