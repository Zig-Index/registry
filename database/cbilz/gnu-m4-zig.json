  "readme": "# GNU M4 packaged for Zig\n\nWork in progress.\n\n## Goal\n\nThis project aims to provide a Zig package for GNU M4 that runs on Linux, macOS\nand Windows without system dependencies. The longer-term goal is to extract a\nreusable Zig library for compiling projects that rely on Autotools and Gnulib.\n\n## Status\n\nCompiles and appears to run correctly on my Linux system when built in\n`ReleaseFast` or `ReleaseSmall` mode. However, with safety checks enabled, the\nexecutable hits an illegal instruction immediately on startup, presumably due to\nundefined behavior.\n\n## Next steps\n\n1. Fix the illegal instruction issue.\n2. Port the test suite and integrate it as a build step.\n3. Implement those configuration checks that do not depend on preprocessing,\n   compilation or execution of probing code. Exclude any unused or redundant\n   checks.\n4. Implement a `LazyValue` system to allow other build steps to pass\n   configuration values to `ConfigHeader`.\n5. Implement remaining configuration checks, again excluding unused or redundant\n   ones.\n6. Extract a reusable configuration library for projects using Autotools or\n   Gnulib.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Uses Zig 0.14.0-dev.3367+1cc388d52.\n\n## Limitations\n\n- Native language support is disabled.\n",
