The\ncore implementation is written in C, with first-class support for Zig\nand Nim through native bindings.\n\n## DESCRIPTION\n\nThe ndarray library emerged from the need to implement algorithms\nrequiring multi-dimensional array operations in C, without sacrificing\nperformance or ergonomics. It provides a foundation for numerical\ncomputing while maintaining zero-copy integration with the GNU\nScientific Library (GSL) for vectors and matrices.\n\nThe library takes a polyglot approach: the core is implemented in C for\nmaximum portability and performance, while Zig and Nim bindings provide\nmodern language conveniences without sacrificing the underlying\nefficiency. Each language binding maintains the same conceptual model\nwhile respecting the idioms of its host language.\n\n## FEATURES\n\nMulti-dimensional arrays: Support for arrays with two or more dimensions\n(ndim >= 2), with arbitrary shapes for efficient memory\nlayouts.\n\nParallel operations: OpenMP parallelization of computationally intensive\noperations, enabling efficient utilization of multi-core processors.\n\nBLAS optimization: Integration with OpenBLAS for high-performance linear\nalgebra operations.\n\nGSL integration: Zero-copy integration with GSL for vectors and\nmatrices, allowing seamless use of GSL's extensive mathematical\nfunctions on ndarray data structures.\n\nLanguage bindings: Native bindings for Zig and Nim, providing idiomatic\ninterfaces while maintaining full access to the underlying C\nimplementation.\n\n## DEPENDENCIES\n\n- OpenMP - for parallel execution\n- OpenBLAS - for optimized linear algebra\n- GSL - for zero-copy integration with scientific computing functions\n\n## GETTING STARTED\n\nFor C Projects: Consult the [C Building](guide/building.md) guide for\ncompilation instructions and linking requirements.\n\nFor Zig Projects: Add the library to your project using the Zig package\nmanager:\n\n    zig fetch --save \"git+https://github.com/jailop/ndarray-c#main\"\n\nSee [Zig Building](guide/zig-building.md) for detailed integration instructions.\n\nFor Nim Projects: The Nim bindings are included in this repository under\nthe nim/ directory.  Add the library to your nimble dependencies or use\nit directly from the source.\n\n    nimble install ndarray\n\n## DOCUMENTATION\n\nDesign philosophy: [Design Considerations](guide/design.md) explains the\narchitectural decisions and trade-offs that shaped this library.\n\nAPI reference: Complete API documentation is available at:\n    \n    https://jailop.github.io/ndarray-c/\n\nAI-generated documentation: An alternative perspective generated by AI\ncan be found at:\n\n    https://deepwiki.com/jailop/ndarray-c\n\n\n## LIMITATIONS\n\nType support: Only double-precision floating point (double) is currently\nsupported for array elements. This decision reflects the library's focus\non numerical computing applications where double precision is standard.\n\nScope: This library implements fundamental operations for\nmulti-dimensional arrays.  For specialized vector and matrix operations,\nthe zero-copy GSL integration provides access to GSL's comprehensive\nfunction library on vectors ([1,D] or [D,1]) and matrices without data\ncopying overhead.\n\nDimension limits (Zig): Zig and Nim bindings impose a maximum of 64 dimensions\ndue to the use of thread-local pre-allocated buffers for type\nconversion. This parameter can be adjusted at compile time if needed.\n\n## DEVELOPMENT STATUS\n\nThis library is under development. The API is not yet stable and\nmay change without notice. While functional and tested, it is not\nrecommended for production use at this time. Feedback and contributions\nare welcomed.\n\n## PENDING DESIGN DECISIONS\n\nError handling: The error management strategy is still being refined.\nCurrently, assertions are used to validate invariants, causing program\ntermination when violated.  A more sophisticated error handling\nmechanism is planned.\n\nNaming conventions: The intention is for function names to indicate\ntheir behavior: functions returning newly allocated arrays or scalars\nare explicitly named, while functions without such indication perform\nin-place operations on the first argument. This convention is still\nbeing refined across the codebase.\n\n## CONTRIBUTING\n\nEnvirioned features and enhancement ideas are tracked in the [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md).\nContributions aligned with the project's goals are welcome.\n\n## LICENSE\n\nThis library is distributed under the BSD 3-Clause License. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE)\nfile for complete terms.\n\n## AUTHOR\n\nJaime Lopez (<https://algo.datainquiry.dev>)\n",
