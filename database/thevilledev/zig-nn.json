This project focuses on understanding the fundamentals of neural networks including hidden layers, activation functions, and basic training processes.\n\n## Features\n\n- Matrix operations from scratch\n- Common activation functions (Sigmoid, Linear, ReLU, Tanh)\n- Advanced activation functions (Swish, GLU, SwiGLU)\n- Basic feed-forward neural network architecture\n- Support for gated architectures used in modern transformer models\n\nSee [examples](examples/).\n\n## Documentation\n\nDetailed documentation is available in the `docs` directory:\n- [Neural Network Architecture](docs/architecture.md) - Design principles and implementation details\n- [Advanced Activation Functions](docs/activation_functions.md) - Detailed information about activation functions\n\n## Building\n\nMake sure you have Zig installed on your system. This project is developed with the latest stable version of Zig.\n\nFor convenience, a Makefile is provided with common operations:\n\n```bash\n# Build and run everything (build, test, examples)\nmake\n\n# Run specific examples, for example:\nmake example-simple-xor\n\n# Build with different optimization modes\nmake BUILD_MODE=ReleaseFast\nmake release  # Build with ReleaseSafe mode\n\n# See all available commands\nmake help\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nThe project includes a comprehensive test suite to verify the functionality of all components. The build system is configured to run tests for each module sequentially, making it easy to identify which component has issues.\n\n```bash\n# Run all tests\nmake test\n\n# Run tests for specific components, for example:\nzig build test-matrix     # Run matrix operation tests\nzig build test-activation # Run activation function tests\nzig build test-layer      # Run neural network layer tests\nzig build test-network    # Run full network tests\n```\n\n## Learning Goals\n\nThis project serves as a learning exercise for:\n\n- Understanding neural network fundamentals\n- Implementing mathematical operations in Zig\n- Working with Zig's memory management and error handling\n\n## License\n\nMIT License \n",
