It will then print the respective syntax literal to it.\n    - `value` is anything you'd like it to print. Should it fail to print a value you feel it should be able to please open an issue.\n    - `print_type_name` is a bool for whether or not you'd like it to print `@typeName(T)` or `.` when printing structs, enums, and unions.\n",
