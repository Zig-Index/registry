  "readme": "# Loki: Simple Password Manager\n\nLoki is a basic password manager for those wanting full control over their password database,\nincluding where it is stored and how it is synced.\n\n## Motivation\n\nI've long been a fan of [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org), but it has one main drawback: syncing\nbetween devices. I've been using Dropbox to sync my `.kdbx` file between my phone, laptop, desktop,\nand other computers, but (particularly on Android) Dropbox does not do a good job at syncing files\nin a timely manner after changes have been made, leading me to commonly have 4 different copies of\nmy database that I need to manually review, merge, and then delete.\n\n## Goals\n\nLoki is intended to be a simplified replacement for KeePassXC users just wanting to store usernames,\npasswords, URLs, and notes in a secure manner, and sync them reliably between all of their devices,\nwith no data lost in the process, _ever_.\n\nLoki is still under development, but is already capable of doing all of the above. The last feature\nneeded to reach MVP status is a merge-conflict resolution view.\n\n## Features\n\n- Simple TUI interface\n- All data is encrypted at rest\n- Git-like data storage\n- Similar functionality as KeePassXC:\n  - Organize entries in folders\n  - Entries contain title, description, username, password, URL, and notes\n  - Password generator with option to specify length and enable different sets of allowed characters\n- Version tracking of all changes\n  - See past versions of an entry\n  - No data is ever truly lost - roll back to a previous version of an entry at any time\n- Automatic syncing of the \"database\" to a remote server (**WIP**)\n  - Git-style push/pull synchronization\n  - Ability for the user to interactively resolve vesrion conflicts (**WIP**)\n\n## Storage Format\n\nSimilar to Git, all entries are stored as binary files inside the Loki database's `objects/`\ndirectory. The filename is the SHA-1 hash of the plaintext contents of the entry, and the contents\nare encrypted using the [Argon2id](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9106/) algorithm before\nwriting to disk.\n\n## TUI Interface\n\nThe TUI interface is fairly bare-bones, and was developed using the\n[`zigzag` library](https://github.com/meszmate/zigzag). At present, a user may create a new\ndatabase, add and \"move\" existing entries, view the complete history of an entry, generate random\npasswords, and copy data to the clipboard for easy logins.\n\n![Editing an entry](docs/images/edit-entry.png)\n\n![Generate a password](docs/images/generate-password.png)\n\n![View an entry's history](docs/images/history-view.png)\n",
