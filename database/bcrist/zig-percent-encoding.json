  "readme": "# Percent (URL) Encoding and Decoding for Zig\n\nThis library can be used in a variety of ways:\n\n* Use `encode()` or `decode()` directly as an iterator.  They will return slices of the output until the whole input string has been encoded or decoded.\n* Use `encode_alloc()` or `decode_alloc()`.  It will always return a single slice allocated from the provided allocator, even if the output is identical to the input.\n* Use `encode_append()` or `decode_append()`.  Instead of an allocator, you can pass a `*std.ArrayList(u8)` and the result will be appended to it.  The input string must not be owned by the ArrayList.\n* Use `encode_maybe_append()` or `decode_maybe_append()`.  Similar to `*_append()`, except the ArrayList won't be modified if the input and output are identical.  The input string must not be owned by the ArrayList.  Returns either the input string, or a slice from the ArrayList.  The ArrayList does not need to be empty and won't be cleared before appending.\n* Use `std.fmt.Formatter` aware APIs with `fmtEncoded()`.\n\n`Encode_Options` can specify which kinds of bytes are encoded independently for:\n* ASCII alphabetical characters (`[A-Za-z]`)\n* Decimal digits (`[0-9]`)\n* spaces\n* ASCII symbols\n* C0 control characters and bytes >= 0x80\n\nThe default `Encode_Options` is conservative; it will encode `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` data according to [HTML's rules](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-urlencoded-serializer), except that spaces will be encoded as `%20` instead of `+`. Servers generally don't care if `%20` or `+` is used, so this shouldn't be a problem, and it means it can also be used safely to escape URI data.  Encoding spaces as `+` can be enabled explicitly if desired.\n\nWhen decoding, `+` _will_ be treated as a space by default, so make sure you turn this off explicitly if you're processing data where `+` is meant to be an unencoded literal `+`.\n\n## Encoding with `std`\n\nConsider using the standard library's [`std.Uri.Component.percentEncode`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.Uri.Component.percentEncode) when:\n* You have a writer available\n* You don't mind creating an `isValidChar` helper function to pass in\n* You don't need to encode spaces as `+`\n\n## Decoding with `std`\n\nThe standard library provides [`std.Uri.percentDecodeInPlace`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.Uri.percentDecodeInPlace)/[`std.Uri.percentDecodeBackwards`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.Uri.percentDecodeBackwards) however these require a preallocated mutable output buffer.  Additionally, they do not support decoding `+` as a space.\n\n## Performance comparison\n\nIt's highly unlikely that percent encoding/decoding will be a bottleneck for most applications, but some performance comparisons with the `std` implementations are provided in the `benchmark.zig` file and can be run with `zig build benchmark`.  As with all microbenchmarks, take the results with several grains of salt.\n\nHere are the results from my machine:\n\n|                                  | Debug     | Release   |\n| -------------------------------- | --------- | --------- |\n| percent_encoding.encode_append   | 6.2 ns/B  | 1.7 ns/B  |\n| percent_encoding.fmtEncoded      | 7.8 ns/B  | 1.9 ns/B  |\n| percent_encoding.encode_writer   | 8.0 ns/B  | 1.8 ns/B  |\n| std.Uri.Component.percentEncode  | 12 ns/B   | 2.4 ns/B  |\n| percent_encoding.decode_in_place | 7.7 ns/B  | 0.84 ns/B |\n| std.Uri.percentDecodeInPlace     | 8.9 ns/B  | 0.83 ns/B |\n",
