  "readme": "# Tempora\n### Simple Zig Dates/Times/Timezones\n\n## Features\n* Efficient storage (32b `Time`, 32b `Date`, 64b `Date_Time`)\n* Composition and decomposition (year, ordinal day/week, month, day, weekday, hour, minute, second, ms)\n    * Uses Ben Joffe's [fast calendar algorithm](https://www.benjoffe.com/fast-date-64)\n* Add/subtract days/hours/minutes/seconds/ms\n* Advance to the next weekday/day/ordinal day\n* Convert to/from unix timestamps\n* Embedded IANA timezone database and modified version of [zig-tzif](https://github.com/leroycep/zig-tzif) (adds about 200k to binary size when used)\n* Query current timezone on both unix and Windows systems\n* Moment.js style formatting and parsing (through `std.fmt`)\n\n## Limitations\n* It's not possible to store most \"out of bounds\" dates/times (e.g. Jan 32).\n* Localized month and weekday names are not supported; only English.\n* Non-Gregorian calendars are not supported.\n* Date/time values directly correspond to timestamps, so accurate durations that take leap seconds into account are not possible (but leap seconds are being abolished in 2035 anyway).\n",
