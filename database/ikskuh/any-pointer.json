  "readme": "# any-pointer type erasure\n\nThis package provides a single file `any-pointer.zig` that implements a type-erased pointer for Zig.\n\nThis pointer type supports three functions `make`, `cast` and `isNull` and exports the symbol `null_pointer`.\n\n```zig\nconst AnyPointer = @import(\"any-pointer\").AnyPointer;\n\nvar i: u32 = 0;\n\nconst erased = AnyPointer.make(*u32, &i);\n\nconst ptr = erased.cast(*u32);\n\nptr.* = 42;\n\nstd.debug.assert(i == 42);\n```\n\nIn safe modes (`Debug` and `ReleaseSafe`) `cast` will type-check the pointer and might `@panic` when a type confusion would happen.\n\n## Usage\n\nJust add a package pointing to `any-pointer.zig` to your project.\n\nThe package will export three types:\n\n- `SafePointer`, which will provide type checking and panics in safe modes.\n- `UnsafePointer`, which will not provide type checking and will only have the size of a single pointer.\n- `AnyPointer`, which will be `SafePointer` in safe modes and `UnsafePointer` in unsafe modes.\n\nIn addition to `make`, `cast` and `isNull`, `SafePointer` also has the function `tryCast` which works like `cast`, but will return an optional.\n",
