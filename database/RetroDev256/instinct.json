  "readme": "# Instinct\n\nAn ultra simple set of distinct integer types.\n\n### Use cases:\n- You don't want to mix up array index types\n- You want safety checks on an integer that must have a range\n- You want the above, but with a value that represents null\n\n### Types:\n```zig\npub fn OptionalRangedInt(\n    comptime T: type,\n    comptime type_id: u32,\n    comptime range: Range(T),\n    comptime null_value: T,\n) type { ... }\n\npub fn OptionalInt(\n    comptime T: type,\n    comptime type_id: u32,\n    comptime null_value: T,\n) type { ... }\n\npub fn RangedInt(\n    comptime T: type,\n    comptime type_id: u32,\n    comptime range: Range(T),\n) type { ... }\n\npub fn Int(\n    comptime T: type,\n    comptime type_id: u32,\n) type { ... }\n```\n\n### Methods:\nEach type provides the following methods:\n- `init` creates a new distinct type\n- `set` changes the value of the distinct type\n- `val` fetches the value of the distinct type\n- `cast` converts the distinct type to another distinct type\nLimitation: you can't directly cast from an optional to non-optional type",
