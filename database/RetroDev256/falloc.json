  "readme": "Ever wanted a zig allocator that could allocate all the free space of your HDD? Look no further! Really though, don't. Unless you have a specific need for this, you likely don't need it ;)\n\nI created this allocator (POSIX systems only right now) for the purpose of single, *very* large allocations. Think lots and lots of math with hundreds of gigabytes in each array.\n\nIt is advised that you use ReleaseFast/ReleaseSmall when using this library. This is because the allocated memory is set to `undefined` by the Allocator interface, which may take a while for large allocations.\n\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst Allocator = std.mem.Allocator;\nconst falloc = @import(\"falloc\");\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    const gpa: Allocator = falloc.allocator;\n\n    // 256 GiB of memory to work with\n    const mem = try gpa.alloc(u8, 1 << 38);\n    defer gpa.free(mem);\n\n    // In a real-world use case scenario, this would be better utilized.\n    const hello = \"Hello, World!\\n\";\n    @memcpy(mem[0..hello.len], hello);\n    std.debug.print(\"{s}\", .{mem[0..hello.len]});\n}\n```\n",
