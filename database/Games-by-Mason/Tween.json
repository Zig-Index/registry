  "readme": "# Tween\n\nRigid motion often appears unnatural. This library provides easing and interpolation functions widely used in game development to create natural looking or stylized tweens (\"inbetweens\").\n\nExample usage:\n```zig\nconst tween = @import(\"tween\");\nconst lerp = tween.interp.lerp;\nconst ease = tween.ease;\n\n// ...\n\npos = lerp(start, end, ease.bounceOut(t));\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nFull documentation available [here](https://docs.gamesbymason.com/tween/), you can generate up to date docs yourself with `zig build docs`.\n\n## Interpolation\n\nThe following interpolation functions are provided:\n* `lerp`\n* `ilerp`\n* `remap`\n* `clamp01`\n* `damp`\n\nLinear interpolation differs from the implementation in the standard library in that it returns exact results at 0 and 1.\n\nAdditionally, it accepts a larger variety of types:\n* Floats\n* Vectors\n* Arrays\n* Structures containing other supported types\n\n`ilerp` is the inverse of `lerp`, and only accepts floats. `remap` uses a combination of `ilerp` and `lerp` to remap a value from one range to another.\n\n`clamp01` is what it sounds like, and is provided for convenience. You can apply it to a `t` value getting passed to `lerp` to create a clamped lerp.\n\n`damp` is useful for [framerate independent lerping](https://www.rorydriscoll.com/2016/03/07/frame-rate-independent-damping-using-lerp/).\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with this class of functions, I recommend viewing [The Simple Yet Powerful Math We Don't Talk About](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzjF1pdlK7Y) by [Freya Holmer](https://www.acegikmo.com/).\n\n## Ease\n\nThe following easing functions are supported, most of these originated with [Robert Penner](http://robertpenner.com/easing/):\n\n* linear\n* [sine](https://easings.net/#easeInSine)\n* [quad](https://easings.net/#easeInQuad)\n* [cubic](https://easings.net/#easeInCubic)\n* [quart](https://easings.net/#easeInQuart)\n* [quint](https://easings.net/#easeInQuint)\n* [exp](https://easings.net/#easeInExpo)\n* [circ](https://easings.net/#easeInCirc)\n* [back](https://easings.net/#easeInBack)\n* [elastic](https://easings.net/#easeInElastic)\n* [bounce](https://easings.net/#easeInBounce)\n* step\n* [smoothstep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothstep)\n* [smootherstep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothstep#Variations)\n\nI've opted to not include GIFs demonstrating the easing styles here, as [easings.net](https://easings.net) already has a great visualizer for almost all of these.\n\n(Note that the links above are provided for convenient reference, the actual implementations may not be 100% identical or may have slightly different parameters.)\n\nIn, out, and in-out variations of each are provided, functions are exact at 0 and 1 for 32 bit floats unless otherwise noted.\n\nEasing functions operate on the `t` value given to `lerp`. For example:\n```zig\nconst result = lerp(a, b, ease.smootherstep(t));\n```\n\nIf you're new to easing and not sure which to use, `smootherstep` is a reasonable default to slap on everything to start.\n\nYou can adapt easing functions with `mix`, `combine`, `reflect`, and `reverse`.\n\nThe provided easing functions are exact at 0 and 1 for 32 bit floats unless otherwise noted.\n\nWhen designing your own easing functions, I highly recommend testing them in [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator).\n\n## Build Configuration\n\nIf you're shipping binaries, you probably have a min spec CPU in mind. I recommend making sure `muladd` is enabled for your baseline so it doesn't end up getting emulated in software, [more info here](https://gamesbymason.com/devlog/2025/#muladd). On x86 this means enabling `fma`, on arm/aarch64 this means enabling either `neon` or `vfp4`.\n",
