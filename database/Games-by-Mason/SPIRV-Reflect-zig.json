  "readme": "# SPIRV-Reflect-zig\n\nA port of [SPIRV-Reflect](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Reflect/) to the Zig build system, and a Zig API for the library.\n\n## Status\n\nThe static library is built nearly identically to the official CMake.\n\nAs for the Zig API, the port was very simple and as far as I know all functionality from the original library is exposed. I only use a small portion of the functionality myself though, mostly related to descriptor set bindings, if I missed anything contributions (or issues) are welcome. It's also possible that I was overly conservative with some pointer types.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe simplest way to use the library is via the Zig API.\n\nZig code:\n```zig\nconst spvr = @import(\"spirv_reflect\");\nvar module = spvr.ShaderModule.init(spv) catch |err| @panic(@errorName(err));\ndefer module.deinit();\n```\n\n`ShaderModule` contains the reflection data.\n\nThe static library is also exported if you want access to the C API.\n\n## SPIRV-Reflect version & upgrade process\n\nThe version of SPIRV-Reflect built is set in `build.zig.zon`.\n\nTo upgrade the static library, simply update this version.\n\nIf you are also using the Zig API, you'll need to also update any public enums or structures that were changed in `src/root`. I recommend looking at a diff to see what changed. You can run the tests to check for obvious mistakes in this process.\n",
