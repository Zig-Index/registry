  "readme": "# SlotMap\nA high performance associative container. Returns a unique persistent key for each added item.\n\nUseful for managing objects with runtime known lifetimes, such as entities in a video game,\nsince keys are never \"dangling.\"\n\nPersistent keys are implemented as indices paired with bit generation counters. Saturated\ngeneration counters are not reused, which means that after creating and destroying\n`capacity * @intFromEnum(Generation.invalid)` entries the slot map will run out of unique keys and\nreturn `error.Overflow` on `put`.\n\nInspired by [SergeyMakeev/slot_map](https://github.com/SergeyMakeev/slot_map).\n\nDocumentation available [here](https://docs.gamesbymason.com/slot_map/), you can generate up to date docs yourself with `zig build docs`.\n\n# Example\n```zig\nvar slots: SlotMap(u8, []const u8) = try .init(gpa, 100);\ndefer slots.deinit(gpa);\n\nconst key = slots.put(\"hello, world!\");\nconst value = slots.get(key).?;\n\nslots.remove(key);\nassert(!slots.exists(key));\n```\n",
