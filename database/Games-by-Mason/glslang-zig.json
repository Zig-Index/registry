  "readme": "# Glslang Zig\n\nGlslang ported to the Zig build system. If you're compiling shaders from the build system, see also [shader_compiler](https://github.com/Games-by-Mason/shader_compiler).\n\nContributions or bug reports are welcome if behavior differs from official build system.\n\n# Zig Version\n\n[`main`](https://github.com/Games-by-Mason/glslang-zig/tree/main) loosely tracks Zig master. For support for Zig 0.14.0, use [v1.0.0](https://github.com/Games-by-Mason/glslang-zig/releases/tag/v1.0.0).\n\n## Usage\n\nSee [glslang-zig](https://github.com/Games-by-Mason/glslang-zig) for example usage.\n\n## Version\n\nSee [build.zig.zon](build.zig.zon) for current version info.\n\n## Known Differences\n\n* The official build process has a web target for the `glslang` artifact, but this project does not. Contributions are welcome.\n* The official build process symlinks `glslang` to `glslangValidator`. This build outputs `glslangValidator` instead of `glslang` and does not provide a symlink because the library artifact is already named `glslang`.\n* The tests are not built.\n* Compiler flags for exceptions, rtti, etc are not configurable (see [build.zig](build.zig) for current values.)\n\n## How To Change the Glslang Version\n\nThe version of glslang is set in [build.zig.zon](build.zig.zon).\n\nGlslang depends on SPIRV-Headers, and SPIRV-Tools. When changing the glslang version you may need to update these dependencies, to find out if this is necessary check your glslang's `known-good.json`.\n\nGlslang and SPIRV-Tools' official build processes generate headers at compile time. These are cached in the `generated` directory, and can be regenerated via the official build processes.\n",
