  "readme": "# Welcome!\n**PDF-Nano** is a small(ish) library for generating simple PDF files.\n\nThe goal of PDF-Nano is to have a lightweight PDF-library usable from Zig, C and Wasm. \n\n### Features\nThe main feature is PDF-Nano's small size. Compiled to wasm, it weighs **less than 64kb**, making it suitable for embedded devices.\nTo keep the code/binary small only a minimal set of features have been and will be added. Currently the following is supported:\n- Text (Latin-1 charset support only)\n- Basic options for fonts, colors and alignment\n- Lines and tables (fixed layout, optionally repeat table header on new page)\n- Page numbers in footer\n\nNice to have at some point:\n- Unify/improve handling of text/table styles\n- Text justify\n\nNot on the todo list (due to code size):\n- TrueType fonts (if you need a small library you probably don't have space for fonts anyway)\n- Pictures such as jpg, png (this would require an image decoder + logic to encode into pdf's raster format)\n- Compression\n\n### How to build\nPDF-Nano is written in Zig, so you will need the Zig compiler. Then simply compile for your target platform (e.g. wasm):\n\n    zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall -Dtarget=wasm32-freestanding\n\n### Build compatibility\n| PDF-Nano     | Zig                        |\n|--------------|----------------------------|\n| **v0.9.x**   | **v0.15.2**                |\n| v0.8.x       | v0.15.x                    |\n| v0.7.0       | v0.15.x                    |\n| v0.6.0       | v0.14.x                    |\n| v0.5.0       | v0.13.0                    |\n| v0.4.0       | v0.13.0                    |\n| v0.3.0       | v0.12.0-dev.3291+17bad9f88 |\n| v0.2.0       | v0.11.0                    |\n| v0.1.0       | v0.11.0                    |\n\n### Usage\nPDF-Nano provides a text-editor like interface, meaning it handles layouting/positioning for you.\nSee an [example here](examples/native/main.c).\n\n```c\n#include <pdf-nano.h>\n\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\n    encoder_handle handle = createEncoder(A4, PORTRAIT);\n    addText(handle, \"Hello world!\");\n    saveAs(handle, \"hello.pdf\");\n    freeEncoder(handle);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThere is also a [typescript wrapper](examples/web/pdf-nano.ts).\n\n### How to add PDF-Nano to your Zig project\nTo use PDF-Nano via Zig's package manager you can add it as a dependency to your project:\n\n    zig fetch --save git+https://github.com/GregorBudweiser/pdf-nano.git\n\nThen in your build.zig file add this:\n\n```zig\nconst pdf_nano_module = b.dependency(\"pdf_nano\", .{\n    .target = target,\n    .optimize = optimize,\n});\nyourModule.addImport(\"pdf_nano\", pdf_nano_module.module(\"pdf_nano\"));\n```\n\nThen in your module's zig code you can import it:\n\n```zig\nconst pdf = @import(\"pdf_nano\");\n```\n",
