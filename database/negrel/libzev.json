  "readme": "# `libzev` - Cross platform event loop.\n\n`libzev` is a low level cross platform event loop inspired by `io_uring`.\n\nIt works as follow:\n* You queue I/O operations\n* You submit I/O operations in submission queue (SQ)\n* You poll for completed operations in completion queue (CQ) and callbacks are\nexecuted\n\n```\n                             libzev                             \n          +-----------------------------------------+           \n        queue                                     poll          \n         I/O                                       I/O          \n      operation              submit             completion      \n+-----+   |    +----+        +----+        +----+   |    +-----+\n| App +---|--->| SQ +------->| Io +------->| CQ +---|--->| App |\n+-----+   |    +----+        +----+        +----+   |    +-----+\n          |                                         |           \n          +-----------------------------------------+           \n```\n\n## Goals\n\nMy goal for `libzev` is to produce a production-quality, permissively licensed,\n`io_uring` like event loop library for Zig and C. It's main purpose is to enable\n__parallelized I/O__ with a focus on __usability__ and __correctness__.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you want to contribute to `libzev` to add a feature or improve the code\ncontact me at [alexandre@negrel.dev](mailto:alexandre@negrel.dev), open an\n[issue](https://github.com/negrel/libzev/issues) or make a\n[pull request](https://github.com/negrel/libzev/pulls).\n\n## :stars: Show your support\n\nPlease give a :star: if this project helped you!\n\n[![buy me a coffee](https://github.com/negrel/.github/blob/master/.github/images/bmc-button.png?raw=true)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/negrel)\n\n## :scroll: License\n\nMIT © [Alexandre Negrel](https://www.negrel.dev/)\n",
