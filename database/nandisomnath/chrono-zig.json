  "readme": "Chrono: Timezone-aware date and time handling\n========================================\n\n\n\nChrono aims to provide all functionality needed to do correct operations on dates and times in the\n[proleptic Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Gregorian_calendar):\n\n* The `DateTime` type is timezone-aware\n  by default, with separate timezone-naive types.\n* Operations that may produce an invalid or ambiguous date and time return `Option` or `MappedLocalTime`\n* Configurable parsing and formatting with an `strftime` inspired date and time formatting syntax.\n* The `Local` timezone works with the current timezone of the OS.\n* Types and operations are implemented to be reasonably efficient.\n\nTimezone data is not shipped with chrono by default to limit binary sizes. Use the companion crate\n[Chrono-TZ](https://crates.io/crates/chrono-tz) or [`tzfile`](https://crates.io/crates/tzfile) for\nfull timezone support.\n\n## Documentation\n\n[`Experimental`](https://nandisomnath.github.io/chrono-zig),  Documentation is not fully prepared.\n\n<!-- See [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/) for the API reference. -->\n\n## Limitations\n\n* Only the proleptic Gregorian calendar (i.e. extended to support older dates) is supported.\n* Date types are limited to about +/- 262,000 years from the common epoch.\n* Time types are limited to nanosecond accuracy.\n* Leap seconds can be represented, but Chrono does not fully support them.\n* No `deprecated` functions are no longer maintained.\n\n## Module features\n\n\n\n## Zig version requirements\n\nThe Minimum Supported Zig Version is currently **Zig 0.14.0**.\n\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under \n* [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis project is a port of the rust version of\n[`Chrono`](https://github.com/chronotope/chrono).  \nIf the rust version have any bug that can have in this project.\n\n\n",
