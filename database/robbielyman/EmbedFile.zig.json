      "name": "1.0.0",
      "body": "- feat: adds `writeSources`, which creates and returns a named `WriteFile` step which collects everything the `EmbedFile` step touches and outputs it into one directory.\r\n- feat: one can now use the `embed-file` executable standalone if desired.\r\n\r\n- BREAKING CHANGE: the signatures of `addFile` and `addDirectory` have changed. taking `sub_path` as an argument was incorrect.\r\n- BREAKING CHANGE: `createModule` is removed; instead use `embed_file.module` directly.\r\n\r\n- KNOWN ISSUE: the Zig build system appears to cache too eagerly when using `addDirectory`—changing the contents of a file inside the directory may not result in the `EmbedFile` step being rerun. `addFile` does not suffer from this deficiency, so users should prefer using it.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/robbielyman/EmbedFile.zig/compare/0.1.1...1.0.0",
