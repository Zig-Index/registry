  "readme": "# Sentry Native\n\nThis is the [sentry-native](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native), packaged for [Zig](https://ziglang.org/).\n\nThis is a build wrapper, which prepars the library which can be linked and exposes the sentry native C API.\n\n_Note_: This will work for simple use-cases, but this still needs more testing.\n\n## Installation\n\nFirst add the dependencies to your project\n\n```shell\n> zig fetch --save git+https://github.com/olksdr/sentry-native.git\n```\n\nAnd after you can import `sentry_native` in yout `build.zig`. _Note_: the dash (\"-\") is replaced with underscore (\"_\") in the name.\n\n```zig\n\nconst sentry_native = b.dependency(\"sentry_native\", .{\n    .target = target,\n    .optimize = optimize,\n    // Only if you run on Unix-like system you might want to link with libcurl (deafult is \"false\").\n    .curl = true,\n    // Only if you are on Windows (default \"false\").\n    .winhttp = true,\n});\n\n\n// Link the Sentry library to your exe.\nexe.linkLibrary(sentry_native.artifact(\"sentry\"));\n// Add the imports to the root module, so you can use those in your code, e.g.:\n// const sentry = @import(\"sentry\");\nexe.root_module.addImport(\"sentry\", sentry_native.module(\"sentry\"));\n\n```\n\nYou might have to install additional dependencies and makes sure the your dev environment is configured and all paths and includes are in-place.\nDifferent systems will have different requirements (e.g. on Windows you might have to install WindowsSDK and make sure that `PATH` is properly set up, etc.).\n\n## Maintenance\n\nWhen updating `sentry-native` to the new relase (or commit), make sure to check and update the list of file `*.c` files, and also make sure that includes are correct.\nWhen updating to the new release, make sure to change also the version in the `build.zig` update fetching new `sentry-native` commit.\n\n### Known limitations:\n\nCurrently only `none` or `inproc` (enabled by default) backends are supported.\n\n### TODO:\n\nAs part of this build the following items still on the list:\n\n- [ ] Support Crashpad backend.\n- [ ] Support Breakpad backend.\n",
