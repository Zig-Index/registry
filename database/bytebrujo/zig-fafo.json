  "readme": "# zig-fafo\n\nBloom filter-based transaction dependency analyzer and parallel scheduler.\n\n## Overview\n\nzig-fafo determines which transactions can safely execute in parallel by using\nBloom filters to approximate read/write set intersection tests.  Transactions\nwhose key sets do not conflict are grouped into batches that can run\nconcurrently.\n\n## Components\n\n- **BloomFilter** -- Probabilistic set membership with configurable\n  false-positive rate.  Uses SipHash-2-4 with distinct seeds for each hash\n  function.\n\n- **ParallelScheduler** -- Accepts transactions annotated with read and write\n  key sets, then produces a sequence of batches via greedy conflict detection.\n\n## Usage\n\n```zig\nconst fafo = @import(\"zig-fafo\");\n\nvar sched = try fafo.ParallelScheduler.init(allocator);\ndefer sched.deinit();\n\ntry sched.submit(tx_id, &read_keys, &write_keys);\nconst batches = try sched.schedule(allocator);\n```\n\n## Build & Test\n\n```sh\nzig build test\n```\n",
