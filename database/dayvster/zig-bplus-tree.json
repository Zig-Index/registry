This package is designed for high performance, reliability, and ease of use—perfect for use as a dependency or as a learning resource for advanced data structures in Zig.\n\n---\n\n## What is a B+ Tree?\nA B+ tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows fast insertions, deletions, and lookups. It is widely used in databases and filesystems.\n\n```\nExample (order 4):\n\n        [ 10 | 20 ]\n       /    |    \\\n   [1 5 7] [12 15] [22 25 30]\n```\n- All values are stored in the leaves.\n- Internal nodes only store keys for navigation.\n- All leaves are linked for fast range/iteration queries.\n\n---\n\n## Features\n- **Generic**: Works with any comparable key/value type.\n- **Self-balancing**: Maintains optimal height for fast operations.\n- **Fast**: O(log n) insert, search, and (future) remove.\n- **Range iteration**: (Planned) Efficient in-order traversal.\n- **Memory safe**: Uses Zig's allocator model.\n- **Tested**: Includes edge cases and stress tests.\n- **MIT licensed**: Free for any use.\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\n### With `zig fetch` (recommended)\n\nFetch and add this repo as a dependency:\n\n```sh\nzig fetch --save git+https://github.com/dayvster/zig-bplus-tree\n```\n\nAdd to your `build.zig.zon` dependencies:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"bplustree\": {\n      \"url\": \"https://github.com/dayvster/zig-bplus-tree/archive/refs/heads/main.zip\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen in your `build.zig`:\n\n```zig\nconst bplustree_mod = b.dependency(\"bplustree\", .{}).module(\"bplustree\");\n// ...\n.imports = &.{ .{ .name = \"bplustree\", .module = bplustree_mod } },\n```\n\nAnd in your code:\n\n```zig\nconst BPlusTree = @import(\"bplustree\").BPlusTree(i32, 4);\n```\n\n### Manual install\n1. Download or clone this repository.\n2. Copy `src/bplustree.zig` into your project (e.g. `lib/bplustree.zig`).\n3. Import it directly:\n```zig\nconst BPlusTree = @import(\"lib/bplustree.zig\").BPlusTree(i32, 4);\n```\n\n---\n\n## Usage Example\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst BPlusTree = @import(\"bplustree\").BPlusTree(i32, 4);\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var tree = BPlusTree.init(&std.heap.page_allocator);\n    defer tree.deinit();\n    try tree.insert(42, 100);\n    const found = tree.search(42);\n    std.debug.print(\"Found: {any}\\n\", .{found});\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Examples\nSee the `examples/` directory for more usage patterns, including:\n- Basic usage\n- Iteration\n- Self-balancing stress test\n\n---\n\n## Tests\nRun all tests:\n```sh\nzig build test\n```\n\n---\n\n## Contributing\nPull requests, bug reports, and feature requests are welcome! Please open an issue or PR on GitHub.\n\n---\n\n## Support\nIf you have questions or need help, open an issue or start a discussion on the repo.\n\n---\n\n## License\nMIT.
